#### Definitions added to 854 concepts:

| Concept URI | PrefLabel | Definition |
| --- | --- | --- |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/0  |  DC stars     |  A white dwarf showing a continuous spectrum with no readily apparent lines.  |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/5  |  A stars  |  A star whose spectrum shows strong hydrogen Balmer lines accompanied by many faint to moderately strong metallic lines. In contrast to B and O stars, the lines of He I and He II are absent. Their surface temperature ranges from 7,500 to 10,000 K. The main metallic lines seen in A-type stars are those of Fe I and Fe II, Cr I and II, Ti I and II, and account for about two-thirds of all lines. Some famous examples of A star are Sirius, Deneb, Altair, and Vega. Also known as A-type star.     |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/9  |  Abell clusters   |  Galaxy clusters listed in the Abell catalog, which is a catalog of 4073 rich galaxy clusters grouped by constellation and by catalog number. Published first in 1958, it contained the clusters visible from the northern hemisphere. A supplement for the southern hemisphere survey was published in 1988.     |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/10     |  Absolute magnitude   |  The magnitude a star would have if it were at a distance of 10 parsecs in a void space, without interstellar absorption. The absolute magnitude is usually deduced from the visual magnitude, measured through a V filter (UBV system), when it is written as M_V. If it is defined for another wavelength, it gets another index (U, B, etc). If the radiation on all wavelengths is included, it becomes absolute bolometric magnitude, M_bol. The Sun has the absolute magnitude +4.8. Most of the stars have absolute magnitudes ranging between -9 (supergiants) and +19 (red dwarfs).  |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/11     |  Abundance ratios     |  The relative amount of a given chemical element with respect to other elements.  |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/12     |  Accelerating universe    |  The deduction based on the observation that the most distant Type Ia supernovae are fainter than that expected from their redshifts in a matter-only dominated expanding Universe. The faintness is attributed to larger distances resulting from an accelerating Universe driven by presence of a new component with strongly negative pressure. This component that makes the Universe accelerate is named dark energy.    |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/14     |  Accretion    |  The process by which an object increases its mass under the influence of its gravitational attraction. Accretion plays a key role in a wide range of astrophysical phenomena. In particular stars result from the accretion of material by a protostar from a surrounding molecular cloud. The accumulation of mass on the protostar involves the formation of an accretion disk. Theoretical and observational investigations of protostars and newborn stars indicate the important role of magnetic fields in this process. They favor the magnetospheric accretion model for mass transfer from the circumstellar disk onto the newborn star. In this model, the stellar magnetosphere truncates the disk at a few stellar radii. Gas from the disk accretes onto the star along the magnetic field lines and hits the stellar surface at approximately the free fall velocity, causing a strong accretion shock. Various emission lines are formed in the infalling magnetospheric flow. Moreover, optical/ultraviolet excess continuum emission is produced in the accretion shocks. The accretion is accompanied by mass ejection through collimated bipolar jets.    |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/15     |  Achondrites  |  A class of stony meteorites that lack chondrules. They are made of rock that has crystallized from a molten state. Achondrites are relatively rare, accounting for about 8% of all meteorite falls.  |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/16     |  Active galactic nuclei   |  A central region of an active galaxy, which is a light-year or less in diameter and has an abnormally high luminosity. The nucleus emits high energy radiation (gamma rays, X-rays, ultraviolet) and shows variability over various time-scales, sometimes very short (hours to weeks). Emission line spectra reveal high velocity motions up to 10^4 km s^-1. AGNs are divided into two main types. Type I refers to an AGN whose nucleus is visible (the spectra has both narrow and broad emission lines), while in type II AGN, the broad line region (BLR) is obscured and the lines are very narrow. This may be due either to the viewing angle or some intrinsic difference in structure.    |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/17     |  Active galaxies  |  A galaxy that produces huge amounts of energy at its center, which cannot be attributed to normal processes from stars, interstellar medium, and their interactions. There are several types of active galaxies: Seyfert galaxies, quasars, and blazars. All of these objects show brightness variations, some as short as 3 hours. These fluctuations indicate a relatively very small size for the central object, because an object cannot vary in brightness faster than light can travel across it. For example, an object that is one light-year in diameter cannot vary significantly in brightness over a period of less than one year.  |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/18     |  Active sun   |  The Sun during its 11-year cycle of activity when spots, flares, prominences, and variations in radiofrequency radiation are at a maximum.   |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/21     |  Aerolites    |  A stony meteorite consisting of silicate minerals. This alternative name for a stony meteorite, is now largely obsolete.     |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/22     |  Aeronomy     |  The study of the upper atmosphere, especially of regions of ionized gas.     |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/23     |  Alfven waves     |  A magnetohydrodynamic wave in a magnetized plasma, arising as a result of restoring forces associated with the magnetic field. It is a transverse wave which propagates in the direction of the magnetic field. Also called magnetohydrodynamic wave.    |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/26     |  Almanacs     |  A book of tables, usually covering a period of one calendar year, that lists the future positions of the Moon, planets, and other prominent celestial objects, together with other useful astronomical data.     |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/27     |  Rapidly oscillating Ap star  |  A chemically peculiar star characterized by the presence of high-frequency non-radial oscillations, with periods that range between about 4 and 16 min. These variations have periods from about 5 to 20 minutes and low amplitudes (B < 10 mmag). They are consistent with acoustic (p mode) pulsations of low degree and high radial overtone.     |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/28     |  Alt-azimuth mounts   |  A telescope mounting which has its two axes of movement aligned with the horizon and the zenith.     |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/31     |  AM Canum Venaticorum stars   |  A binary system that has very short orbital period (less than one hour) and helium dominated spectrum. The prototype, AM Canum Venaticorum, with a period of 17 minutes, was discovered in 1967. AM CVn stars are semidetached binary systems in which accretion is going on. The donor star is hydrogen deficient and the accretor is usually a white dwarf. To fit within their Roche lobes, the donor stars must be dense, suggesting they may be degenerate too. It is at present thought that AM CVn stars represent three possible evolutionary phases in 1) double white dwarf systems, 2) white dwarf and helium star binaries, and 3) cataclysmic variables with evolved donors.    |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/33     |  Am stars     |  A chemically peculiar A- or early F-type star showing an overabundance of heavy elements and an underabundance of calcium and scandium. An Am star cannot receive a unique spectral type, as different methods (using the metallic lines, the hydrogen Balmer lines, and the calcium Ca II K-lines) yield three different spectral types. Contrarily to Ap stars, Am stars do not have significant external magnetic fields. Their rotational velocities are about 100-120 km s-1 smaller than those of Ap stars.    |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/34     |  Amateur astronomers  |  A person who engages in astronomy as a pastime rather than as a profession.  |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/35     |  Amateur astronomy    |  The astronomical activities carried out by amateur astronomers.  |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/36     |  Amor group   |  A near-Earth asteroid (NEA) with perihelion distances between 1.017 and 1.3 astronomical units. The Amor asteroids approach the orbit of the Earth from beyond, but do not intersect it. Most Amors do cross the orbit of Mars. It is estimated that 32% of the total number of NEAs are Amors. One of the larger Amors is Eros.     |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/39     |  Andromeda Galaxy     |  The nearest spiral galaxy to our own and a major member of the Local Group. It lies in the constellation Andromeda and is the most remote object normally visible to the naked eye. The earliest known reference to this galaxy is by the Iranian astronomer Sufi who called it 'the little cloud' in his Book of Fixed Stars (A.D. 964).    |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/40     |  Angular separation   |  Between two points A and B, the angle subtended by lines drawn from an observing point O to A and B.     |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/41     |  Annual equation  |  An irregularity in the Moon's orbit, which can amount to 11 degrees in a period of one year. It results from the Sun's disturbing effect on the motion of the Moon due to varying distance between them.     |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/42     |  Annual parallax  |  The difference in position of a star as seen from the Earth and Sun, i.e. the angle subtended at a star by the mean  radius of the Earth's orbit around the Sun. Same as heliocentric parallax.  Because the Earth revolves around the Sun, we observe the sky from a constantly moving position in space. Therefore, we should expect to see an annual effect, in which the positions of nearby objects appear to oscillate back and forth in response to our motion around the Sun. This does in fact happen, but the distances to even the nearest stars are so great that we need to make careful observations with a telescope to detect it. The annual parallax of the nearest star, Proxima Centauri, is 0.762 arcsec, which is too small for our acuity of vision.   |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/43     |  Annular eclipses     |  A solar eclipse in which the Moon is close the apogee and is, therefore, too small to cover the whole disk of the Sun, leaving a visible edge or ring of sunlight. An annular eclipse can last for 12m 30s at the most.  |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/44     |  Anomalistic month    |  The time interval of 27.554551 days (27d 13h 18m 33.2s), on average, between two successive passages of the Moon through the  perigee of its orbit.  |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/45     |  Ansae    |  The 'handles,' or extremities, of planetary rings, especially Saturn's, as viewed from Earth.    |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/46     |  Antapex  |  The direction in the sky (in the constellation Columba) away from which the Sun seems to be moving (at a speed of 19.4 km/s) relative to general field stars in the Galaxy.  |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/48     |  Anthropic principle  |  The idea that the existence of life and, in particular, our presence as intelligent observers, constrains the nature of the Universe. It is an attempt to explain the observed fact that the fundamental constants of nature are just right or fine-tuned to allow the Universe and life to exist.   |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/49     |  Antumbra     |  That part of the Moon's shadow that extends beyond the umbra. It is similar to the penumbra in that the Sun is only partially blocked by the Moon. From within the antumbra, the Sun appears larger than the Moon which is seen in complete silhouette. An annular eclipse is seen when an observer passes through the antumbra.     |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/50     |  Ap stars     |  Stars of spectral type A in which lines of ionized metals and rare-earth elements are abnormally enhanced. Such stars have unusually strong magnetic fields, thousands of times stronger than the Sun's typical surface field. Ap stars are generally slow rotators because of magnetic braking.     |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/51     |  Apastron     |  The point at which a binary star is furthest from its companion.     |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/52     |  Interstellar objects     |  A body other than a star or substellar object not gravitationally bound to a star. Its hyperbolic orbit would indicate an object not bound to the Sun. The first known ISO is 1I/'Oumuamua. ISOs are icy planetesimals that are expected to behave like the long-period comets of the solar system; volatile ices sublimate when the ISO approaches the Sun, developing a coma and a dust tail -- features that should make them bright and therefore easy to spot. The rocky ISOs, on the other hand, only reflect sunlight. As their albedo is expected to be extremely low they become dark (after eons of bombardment by high-energy cosmic rays), they would be extremely faint and hard to detect.     |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/53     |  Aperture synthesis   |  The method of combining the signals received by several smaller telescopes distributed over a very large area or baseline to provide the high angular resolution of a much large telescope.  |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/54     |  Apex     |  The point on the celestial sphere toward which the Sun is apparently moving relative to the local standard of rest. Its position, in the constellation Hercules, is approximately R.A. 18h, Dec. +30°, close to the star Vega. The velocity of this motion is estimated to be about 19.4 km/sec (about 4 AU/year). As a result of this motion, stars seem to be converging toward a point in the opposite direction, the solar antapex.  |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/55     |  Aphelion     |  The point in the orbit of a planet, or other object in the solar system, which is furthest from the Sun.     |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/56     |  Apocenter    |  The point on an elliptic orbit at the greatest distance from the principal focus or center of attraction.    |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/57     |  Apogee   |  The point in the orbit of the moon or an artificial satellite that is farthest from the terrestrial center and at which the body's velocity is at a minimum.     |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/58     |  Apollo group     |  A member of a class of near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) that have orbital semi-major axes greater than that of the Earth (> 1 astronomical unit) but perihelion distances less than the Earth's aphelion distance (less than 1.017 AU); thus, they cross the Earth's orbit when near the perihelia of their orbits. They are named for the prototype Apollo.  |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/59     |  Apparent magnitude   |  A measure of a star's observed brightness (opposed to absolute magnitude); symbol m. It depends on the star's intrinsic brightness, its distance from the observer, and the amount of interstellar absorption. The brightest star Sirius has an apparent magnitude of -1.46, while the weakest stars visible with the naked eye in the most favorable observation conditions have magnitudes of about +6.5. The stars of magnitudes less than +23 are measured by professional observatories, whereas those of magnitudes less than +30 by a telescope such as the Hubble Space Telescope.   |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/60     |  Apparent position    |  A position given by the coordinates calculated for a star, if it were seen from the Earth's center, relative to the real equator and the real equinox, at a certain date. It includes the displacements from one heliocentric direction, given in a stellar catalogue, due to precession, nutation, aberration, proper motions, annual parallax, and light gravitational deviation.  |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/62     |  Apsidal motion   |  Rotation of the line of apsides in the plane of the orbit in the same direction as the revolution of the secondary body. The major axis of the Earth's orbit rotates by 11.6 arcseconds per year.    |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/63     |  Apsides  |  The point of greatest or least distance of the orbit of a celestial body from a center of attraction. The closest point is the periapsis, the further point the apoapsis.    |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/64     |  Archaeoastronomy     |  The study that deals with the astronomical knowledge of prehistoric peoples (season events, calendars, observing sites, astronomical alignments) and its influence on their cultures and societies (mythologies, religions, life). Archaeoastronomy covers the intersection between astronomy and archaeology.   |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/65     |  Argument of perigee  |  The angular distance between the ascending node of an object orbiting the Earth and its perigee, measured from the Earth.    |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/66     |  Argument of perihelion   |  The angular distance between the ascending node of an object orbiting the Sun and its perihelion. Argument of perihelion is measured in the orbital plane with respect to the Sun and in the direction of motion. It is one of the orbital elements and usually shown with the symbol ω.     |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/67     |  Armillary spheres    |  An ancient instrument, used since ancient times until the Middle ages and later, to determine positions of celestial bodies. It consisted of an assemblage of rings, all circles of the same sphere, designed to represent the positions of the important circles of the celestial sphere.   |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/68     |  Artificial satellites    |  A man-made equipment that orbits around Earth or a solar system body.    |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/69     |  Ascending node   |  The point in an orbit where the orbiting body crosses a reference plane, such as the ecliptic or the celestial equator, going from south to north. The celestial longitude of the ascending node is one of the elements of the orbit.    |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/70     |  Asteroid belt    |  The region of the solar system located between Mars and Jupiter where over a million objects bigger than 1 km across orbit the Sun.  |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/72     |  Asteroids    |  A small rocky object orbiting the Sun. There are millions of asteroids moving in orbits in the main asteroid belt, between Mars and Jupiter and in the Kuiper belt. The largest and the first discovered, Ceres, about 1,000 km in size, is now classified as dwarf planet (2006 IAU General Assembly). The largest asteroid in the solar system (Ceres apart), is Pallas, with a size of 582 x 556 x 500 km. On the other hand, the smallest asteroid ever studied is the 2 meters space rock 2015 TC25, which was observed when it made a close flyby of Earth in October 2015.    |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/73     |  Asteroseismology     |  The study of the internal structure of stars through the interpretation of their pulsation periods (stellar pulsation). The radial pulsations are the result of sound waves resonating in the stars interior. Different pulsation modes penetrate to different depths inside a star. If a large number of pulsation modes occurs, then the stellar interior, which is not directly observable, can be probed from oscillation studies because the modes penetrate to various depths inside the star. Using a complex mathematical analysis, very detailed investigations of the structure of the star's interior can be carried out. Applied to the Sun, it is called helioseismology.   |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/74     |  Astrobiology     |  The study of life throughout the Universe, also known as exobiology.     |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/75     |  Astrochemistry   |  The study of the chemical interactions between the gas and dust of the interstellar medium.  |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/76     |  Astrodynamics    |  The science dealing with the motion of satellites, rockets, and spacecrafts. It uses the principles of celestial mechanics.  |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/79     |  Astrometric binary stars     |  A binary star in which the presence of an unresolved companion is revealed by small oscillations in the movement of the visible component caused by the gravitational influence of the unseen component.     |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/80     |  Astrometry   |  The precise measurement of the positions and motions of astronomical objects.    |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/81     |  Astronomers  |  A person who practices astronomy as a profession rather than as a hobby, in contrast to an amateur astronomer.   |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/82     |  Astronomical coordinate systems  |  Values in a reference system used to relate the position of a body on the celestial sphere. Four main coordinate systems are utilized in astronomy: the equatorial, horizontal, ecliptic, and galactic coordinates systems.  |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/83     |  Astronomy databases  |  A combined and coordinated set of data that supplies astronomy information for a specific purpose in a variety of forms.     |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/84     |  Astronomical detectors   |  A device whose main function is detection.  Any device or array of electronic sensors connected to a computer, used to detect the passage of a particle or photon; e.g. a charge-coupled device (CCD).   |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/92     |  Astronomical seeing  |  A measure of the blurring and degradation of the image of astronomical objects caused by turbulence in the Earth's atmosphere, including the telescope environment. Seeing causes the images of stars to break up into speckle patterns, which change very rapidly with time.    |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/93     |  Astronomical sextants    |  An instrument used mainly in nautical astronomy to determine the angular distances of celestial bodies above the horizon. The sextant consists of a 60° graduated arc, or limb, a small telescope, and two mirrors. Only half of one of the mirrors, the horizon glass, is silvered and, like the telescope, it is fastened to the frame supporting the limb. The other mirror, the index mirror, moves with an index arm pivoted at the center of the arc. The index arm is equipped with a vernier which moves along the limb. An object in direction S can be observed in the telescope through the un-silvered portion of the horizon glass. By moving the index arm, the second object S' is made to coincide with S in the telescope. According to the law of reflection, the angle between S and S' is double the angle between the mirrors. The angular distance between the objects can therefore be obtained from the measurement of angles between the planes of the mirrors.     |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/95     |  Astronomical unit    |  A unit of length equal to 149,597,870,700 m exactly, with symbol 'au' (re-definition at the International Astronomical Union's 28th General Assembly in Beijing, China, August 20-31). The astronomical unit equals 1.5813 x 10^-5 light-years and 4.8481 x 10^-6 parsecs.   |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/97     |  Astrophotography     |  The photography of stars, other celestial bodies, and stellar fields.    |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/105    |  Astrophysicists  |  A scientist who studies astrophysics.    |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/108    |  Asymptotic giant branch  |  A region of the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram populated by evolving low-mass to intermediate-mass stars. These stars have an electron degenerate core of carbon and oxygen surrounded by two burning shells of helium and hydrogen. The H and He-burning shells are activated alternately in the deep layers of the star. An extended and tenuous convection envelope, having a radius of 10^4 - 10^5 times the size of the core, lies above these shells. The loosely bound envelope is gradually eroded by the strong stellar wind, which forms a dusty circumstellar envelope out to several hundreds of stellar radii. The convective envelope, stellar atmosphere, and circumstellar envelope have a rich and changing chemical composition provided by nucleosynthesis processes in the burning shells in the deep interior.     |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/110    |  Aten group   |  A member of a class of near-Earth asteroids with perihelion distances between 0.983 and 1.0 astronomical units. It is estimated that 6% of the total number of NEAs are Atens.   |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/112    |  Atmospheric circulation  |  The large-scale movements of air around areas of high and low pressure whereby heat is distributed on the surface of the Earth. Atmospheric motion is driven by uneven heating of the planet. The atmosphere (and ocean) transfers the excess heat from tropics to poles. The flow is determined by balance between pressure gradients and the Coriolis effect.  |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/114    |  Atmospheric extinction   |  The decrease in the intensity of light from a celestial body due to absorption and scattering by Earth's atmosphere. It increases from the zenith to the horizon and affects short wavelengths more than long wavelengths, so that objects near the horizon appear redder than they do at the zenith.    |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/115    |  Atmospheric refraction   |  The shift in apparent direction of a celestial object caused by the bending of light while passing through the Earth's atmosphere. Since the density of the atmosphere decreases with altitude, the starlight will bend more as it continues down through the atmosphere. As a result, a star will appear higher in the sky than its true direction.     |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/123    |  Autumnal equinox     |  One of the two points where the ecliptic crosses the celestial equator. At the autumnal equinox the Sun appears to be moving across the equator from the northern celestial hemisphere to the southern celestial hemisphere. The instant of the event.   |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/124    |  Azimuth  |  The angular distance from the North point eastward to the intersection of the horizon with the vertical circle passing through the object. Azimuth is 0° for an object due north, 90° due east, 180° due south, and 270° due west.  Altitude and azimuth constitute the horizon coordinate system.   |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/128    |  B stars  |  A star of spectral type B, whose spectrum is marked by absorption lines of hydrogen; also known as B-type star. B-type optical spectra are characterized by the presence of neutral He lines (mainly He I 4471 Å) at about type B9. He I strengthens up to about B2, then decreases. Ionized helium (mainly He II 4541 Å) first appears at about B0. Most metallic lines are absent or weak, except some absorption lines for the higher ionization states of silicon, oxygen, carbon, and magnesium. These are hot stars with effective temperatures ranging from about 10,000 K at B9 to nearly 30,000 K at B0. They are between 3 and 20 solar masses. Some famous examples include  Rigel, Achernar, and Hadar.  |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/131    |  Baade-Wesselink method   |  A method used to determine the size of certain types of pulsating stars, including Cepheids, from their magnitude variations (photometry) and the corresponding radial velocities (spectroscopy).    |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/133    |  Baily's beads    |  A phenomenon that occurs during a total eclipse of the Sun. Just prior to and after totality, sunlight shines through the lunar valleys on the Moon's limb, causing the dark face of the Moon to appear to be surrounded by a shining 'necklace of pearls'.  |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/135    |  Barium stars     |  A type of star, usually G or K giants, whose spectra show unusually strong absorption lines of barium, strontium, and other s-process elements.  |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/136    |  Barred spiral galaxies   |  A spiral galaxy that exhibits a bar-shaped structure in its nucleus.     |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/137    |  Baryogenesis     |  The hypothetical mechanism of creating the baryon asymmetry in the Universe. Explaining the observed matter asymmetry is an important open question in physical cosmology.   |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/138    |  Baryon acoustic oscillations     |  In cosmology, one of a series of peaks and troughs that are present in the power spectrum of matter fluctuations after the recombination era, and on large scales. At the time of the Big Bang, and for about 380,000 years afterwards, Universe was ionized and photons and baryons were tightly coupled. Acoustic oscillations arose from perturbations in the primordial plasma due to the competition between gravitational attraction and gas+photons pressure. After the epoch of recombination, these oscillations froze and imprinted their signatures in both the CMB and matter distribution. In the case of the photons, the acoustic mode history is manifested as the high-contrast Doppler peaks in the temperature anisotropies. As for baryons, they were in a similar state, and when mixed with the non-oscillating cold dark matter perturbations, they left a small residual imprint in the clustering of matter on very large scales, ~100 h^-1 Mpc (h being the Hubble constant in units of 100 km s^-1 Mpc^-1). The phenomenon of BAOs, recently discovered using the Sloan Digital Sky Survey data, is a confirmation of the current model of cosmology. Like Type Ia supernovae, BAOs provide a standard candle for determining cosmic distances. The measurement of BAOs is therefore a powerful new technique for probing how dark energy has affected the expansion of the Universe.     |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/140    |  Baryonic dark matter     |  Dark matter made up of baryons that are not luminous enough to produce any detectable radiation. It is generally believed that most dark matter is non-baryonic. The baryonic dark matter could reside in a number of forms, including cold gas and compact objects.     |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/142    |  Be stars     |  A hot star of spectral type B showing Balmer lines in emission. Be stars are fast rotators (spinning at about 200 km/sec) and have strong stellar winds with important mass loss.    |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/152    |  Big Bang theory  |  A theory which states that the Universe came into existence in an 'instantaneous' event some 14 billion years ago. Matter was created in that initial event and as time has gone by the Universe has expanded and the contents evolved into the galaxies and stars and of today. The Big Bang is sometimes described as an 'explosion.' However, matter and energy did not erupt into a pre-existing space, since they came into being simultaneously with space and time.   |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/154    |  Binary stars     |  Two stars gravitationally bound to each other, so that they revolve around their common center of gravity.   |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/155    |  Bipolar nebulae  |  An interstellar cloud of ionized gas with two main lobes which lie symmetrically on either side of a central star. The bipolar shape is generally due to the ejection of material by the central star in opposing directions.    |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/162    |  Black holes  |  A fantastically compact object, predicted by the theory of general relativity, whose gravity is so powerful that not even light can escape from it. A black hole forms when matter collapses to infinite density, producing a singularity of infinite curvature in the fabric of space-time. Each black hole is surrounded by an event horizon, at which the escape velocity is the speed of light. The Schwarzschild radius for the Sun is about 3 km and for the Earth about 1 cm. There is observational evidence for black holes on a remarkable range of scales in the Universe: stellar black hole, intermediate-mass black hole, primordial black hole, mini black hole, supermassive black hole, Schwarzschild black hole, Kerr black hole.  |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/164    |  Blazars  |  A term specifying BL Lac objects or quasars when the continuum radiation emitted from the active nucleus is highly polarized and very variable.  |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/165    |  Blue compact dwarf galaxies  |  An small irregular galaxy undergoing violent star formation activity. These objects appear blue by reason of containing clusters of hot, massive stars which ionize the surrounding interstellar gas. They are chemically unevolved since their metallicity is only 1/3 to 1/30 of the solar value.  |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/167    |  Blue loop    |  An evolutionary behavior of certain stars, particularly massive stars, which return to the blue stage after becoming a red supergiant. The phenomenon appears as a blueward loop on the theoretical evolutionary tracks.     |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/168    |  Blue straggler stars     |  Any of stars, often found in globular clusters and old open clusters, that lie on the blueward extension of the main sequence beyond the turnoff point. Blue stragglers have an anomalously blue color and high luminosity in comparison with other cluster members. The most probable ways in which they could form are: mass transfer or coalescence in close binary systems, encounters or collisions in overcrowded cores of globular clusters.  |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/169    |  Blueshifted  |  The apparent shift of the wavelength towards the shorter wavelength region of the radiation spectrum of an approaching object due to the Doppler effect.     |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/170    |  Bode's law   |  The empirical rule relating the approximate distances of the solar system planets from the Sun. The original formulation was: a = (n + 4) / 10, where a is the mean distance of a planet from the Sun in astronomical units and n = 0, 3, 6, 12, 24, 48, 96, 192 (doubling for each successive planet). The planets were seen to fit this sequence quite well, provided the asteroids between Mars and Jupiter are counted as one planet, as did Uranus discovered in 1781. However, Neptune and the ex-planet Pluto do not conform to the rule. The question of whether there is any physical significance to the 'law,' i.e. some dynamical reason that will explain planetary orbit spacing has led to much discussion during the past two centuries. Today, many astronomers are very skeptical and consider this 'law' to be numerical coincidence.     |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/172    |  Bolides  |  A meteor which is extremely bright, particularly one that breaks up during its passage through the atmosphere.   |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/173    |  Bolometric correction    |  The difference between the visual magnitude and bolometric magnitude.    |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/174    |  Bondi accretion  |  The accretion of mass by a star (assumed as point particle) moving at a steady speed through an infinite, uniform gas cloud. It is directly proportional to the star mass (M) and the medium density (ρ) and inversely proportional to the relative star/gas velocity (v).   |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/180    |  Bright nebulae   |  In contrast to a dark nebula, a bright cloud of interstellar gas and dust. The term designates both emission nebulae and reflection nebulae.     |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/182    |  Brightness temperature   |  In radio astronomy, the temperature of a source calculated on the assumption that it is a blackbody emitting radiation of the observed intensity at a given wavelength.  |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/185    |  Brown dwarfs     |  A star-like object whose mass is too small to sustain hydrogen fusion in its interior and become a star. Brown dwarfs are substellar objects and occupy an intermediate regime between those of stars and giant planets. With a mass less than 0.08 times that of the Sun (about 80 Jupiter masses), nuclear reactions in the core of brown dwarfs are limited to the transformation of deuterium into Helium-3. The reason is that the cores of these objects are supported against gravitational collapse by electron degeneracy pressure (at early spectral types) and Coulomb pressure (at later spectral types). Brown dwarfs, as ever cooling objects, will have late M dwarf spectral types within a few Myrs of their formation and gradually evolve as L, T and Y dwarfs brown dwarf cooling. As late-M and early-L dwarfs, they overlap in temperature with the cool end of the stellar main sequence (M dwarf, L dwarf, T dwarf, Y dwarf). In contrast to the OBAFGKM sequence, the M-L-T-Y sequence is an evolutionary one.  |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/191    |  Calendars    |  Any of various systems for measuring and recording the passage of time by dividing the year into days, weeks, and months. A table showing the months, weeks, and days in at least one specific year.     |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/195    |  Carbon burning   |  The stage in the evolution of a star after helium burning when the core of the star consists mainly of carbon and oxygen. In stars of mass greater than about 8 solar masses, whose cores reach a temperature above 5 x 10^8 K and density above 3 x 10^9 kg m^-3, carbon burning can begin via reactions such as the following:  12C + 12C → 20Ne + 4He or 12C + 12C → 23Na + p or 12C + 12C → 23Mg + n.  The time-scale for this phase of nucleosynthesis is of order of five hundred years.   |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/196    |  Carbon dioxide   |  CO_2, also called carbonic acid gas. A colorless gas which occurs in the atmosphere playing an essential part in animal respiration and the growth of green plants.  It is formed by the oxidation of carbon and carbon compounds. Carbon dioxide is the most important greenhouse gas produced by human activities, primarily through the combustion of fossil fuels. Its concentration in the Earth's atmosphere has risen by more than 30% since the Industrial Revolution. CO_2 forms a solid at -78.5 °C at atmospheric pressure, and is used as a refrigerant in this form as a dry ice for the preservation of frozen foods. As carbon dioxide gas is heavier than air and does not support combustion, it is used in fire extinguishers.  CO_2 is present in the interstellar medium and is one of the main molecules in comets.     |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/199    |  Carbon stars     |  A class of red giant stars whose spectra show strong molecular bands of carbon compounds.    |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/200    |  Carbonaceous chondrites  |  A rare type of stony meteorite having a higher carbon content than other classes of meteorite. They represent only ~5% of the known meteorites. Their bulk composition is mainly silicates, oxides and sulfides, whilst the minerals olivine and serpentine are characteristic. The six classes of carbonaceous chondrites are: CI chondrites, CM chondrites, CV chondrites, CO chondrites, CK chondrites, CR chondrites, CH chondrites, and CB chondrites.  |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/202    |  Cassegrain telescopes    |  A reflecting telescope whose primary mirror has a hole bored through the center to allow the reflected light from the convex secondary mirror be focused beyond the back end of the tube.    |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/203    |  Cataclysmic variable stars   |  A variable star that shows a sudden and dramatic change in brightness, including flare stars, novae, and some types of symbiotic stars. They are believed to be very close binary systems consisting of an accreting white dwarf primary and an evolved late-type secondary star that has filled its Roche lobe. For systems with an accretion disk, it is believed that a thermal instability is the cause of repetitive outbursts observed in cataclysmic variables called dwarf novae.    |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/205    |  Catalogs     |  A list or record of items systematically arranged with descriptive details.  |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/210    |  Celestial equator    |  An imaginary great circle on the sky half-way between the celestial poles. It is the projection of the equator of the Earth on the sky.  |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/211    |  Celestial mechanics  |  The branch of astronomy that deals with the calculation of motions of celestial bodies under the action of their mutual gravitational attractions.   |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/213    |  Celestial poles  |  The point of the sky, north or south, where the projection of the Earth's axis of rotation intersects the celestial sphere. They are at 90° relative to the celestial equator. Because of precession, the celestial poles describe a circle around the ecliptic's poles every 25,800 years.  |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/214    |  Celestial sphere     |  An imaginary sphere, of large but indefinite dimension, used as a basis to define the position coordinates of celestial bodies. The center can be the Earth, the observer, or any other point which plays the role of origin for a given system of coordinates. Seen from the Earth, the celestial sphere rotates around the celestial axis every 23h 56m 04s (the sidereal day), as a result of the Earth's rotation. Two important circles on the celestial sphere are the celestial equator and the ecliptic. The angle between them, about 23.40 degrees, is known as the obliquity of the ecliptic. The celestial equator and the ecliptic intersect at two points, vernal equinox and autumnal equinox. The positions of the celestial poles and therefore that of the celestial equator move gradually on the celestial sphere, due to precession.    |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/215    |  Centaur group    |  An asteroid whose orbit around the Sun lies typically between the orbits of Jupiter and Neptune (5 to 30 astronomical units). The first Centaur, called Chiron, was discovered in 1977, but since then more than 100 roughly similar objects have been found. Three centaurs, Chiron, 60558 Echeclus, and 166P/NEAT 2001 T4, have been found to display cometary comas. Chiron and 60558 Echeclus are now classified as both asteroids and comets. Most of the Centaur asteroids are probably dormant comets from the Kuiper belt which have been pulled in by the gravity of outer planets.     |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/216    |  Center of mass   |  A fixed point in a body through which the resultant force of gravitational attraction acts.  |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/218    |  Cepheid variable stars   |  A class of luminous, yellow supergiants that are pulsating variables and whose period of variation is a function of their luminosity. These stars expand and contract at extremely regular periods, in the range 1-50 days. Their highest brightness and surface temperature occur when their expansion velocity is greatest. Similarly, their minima in brightness and temperature occur when they are in the contraction phase. The longer the period, the more luminous the star. The process that drives the pulsation of Cepheid variables is the kappa mechanism. In fact, Cepheids provide one of the most powerful tools for measuring distances to other galaxies (period-luminosity relation). However, this method is limited to the distance of the Virgo cluster of galaxies (15-20 Mpc) even with the HST or the largest ground-based telescopes. One particularly special Cepheid is the North Star, Polaris.     |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/219    |  Ceres    |  Once qualified as the largest known asteroid, Ceres is now classified as a dwarf planet (2006 IAU General Assembly). It is approximately 950 km across, and resides with tens of thousands of asteroids in the main asteroid belt; it is the largest body of the belt. Its mass is 9.4 x 10^20 kg, its rotation period 9.074 hours, its orbital period 4.60 years, and its semi-major axis 2.767 AU. NASA's Dawn spacecraft, which was placed in orbit around Ceres in 2015, has mapped its surface in great detail. Dawn discovered very bright spots, which reflect far more light than their much darker surroundings. The most prominent of these spots lie inside the crater Occator and suggest that Ceres may be a much more active world than most of its asteroid neighbors.    |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/224    |  Chemical abundances  |  The relative amount of a given chemical element or chemical compound with respect to another element or compound in a given sample.  |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/225    |  Chemical enrichment  |  The process by which the relative abundance of a given chemical element or species in an astrophysical object is increased. For example the increase of the heavy element content of the interstellar medium due to stellar evolution.   |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/226    |  Chemically peculiar stars    |  Main sequence stars of spectral type A or B identified by the presence of anomalously strong or weak absorption lines of certain elements in their spectra. CP stars have been divided into four main classes on the basis of their spectra: 1) non-magnetic metallic-lined (CP1, Am star), magnetic (CP2, Ap star), non-magnetic mercury-manganese (CP3, HgMn star), and helium-weak (CP4, He-weak star).   |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/228    |  Chondrites   |  The most common type of meteorites containing chondrules. These stony meteorites make up about 86% of all meteorites. An important feature of the chondrites is that, with the exception of a few highly volatile elements, they have the same composition as the Sun.   |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/229    |  Chondrules   |  Millimeter-sized grains of silicate sometimes found in large numbers in chondrite meteorites. They are essentially glassy beads made by a violent but brief heating event that caused dust grains to form melt droplets. However, the cause of the heating remains unknown.  |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/235    |  Circumstellar disks  |  Any concentration of material in the form of a disk orbiting around a star.  |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/236    |  Circumstellar dust   |  Interstellar dust grains localized around various types of stars, such as asymptotic giant branch stars. Circumstellar dust occurs in the form of a spherical shell or a disk and is at the origin of an infrared excess for the central star.   |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/237    |  Circumstellar envelopes  |  A very extensive envelope of cold gaseous materials surrounding evolved cool stars, notably red giants, red supergiants (Mira variables), or asymptotic giant branch stars. The typical size of such envelopes is several thousand times that of the stellar radius and their temperature ranges from 1000 to 10 K. Circumstellar envelopes result from mass loss from the central star (10-7 to 10-4 solar masses per year) and expand with moderate velocities (10 to 15 km sec^-1). The low temperature of the envelope is at the origin of the formation of molecules, which in certain conditions provide maser emission (H_{2}O, OH, SiO). Similarly, dust grains form in the envelope produce an infrared excess emission.    |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/240    |  Circumstellar masers     |  Maser emission from molecules in the circumstellar envelopes of red giants, and also from regions around protostars.     |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/241    |  Circumstellar matter     |  Dust, gas and plasma around stars, generally present in the form of stellar winds or nebulae ejected by the stars.   |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/242    |  Circumstellar shells     |  A shell of dust, molecules, and neutral gas around an evolved star resulting from an intensive mass loss phase, such as the asymptotic giant branch phase for low- and intermediate mass stars and LBVs or supernovae for massive stars.     |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/252    |  Classical T Tauri stars  |  A T Tauri star in which accretion from a circumstellar disk is responsible for ultraviolet and infrared excess emission and for a moderate to strong emission line spectrum superimposed on the photospheric spectrum. Classical T Tauri stars probably evolve into weak-line T Tauri stars when their disks are fully accreted by the stars.    |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/253    |  Classification systems   |  Systems for the grouping of astronomical objects into categories on the basis of physical, morphological, or evolutionary characteristics.   |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/254    |  Close binary stars   |  A binary system in which the separation of the component stars is comparable to their diameters, so that they influence each other's evolution most commonly by the tidal forces.    |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/255    |  Close encounters     |  In a star cluster, coming across of two stars so closely that their orbits alter by their mutual gravitational attractions. As regards an asteroid or comet, a situation when it crosses the Moon's orbit and approaches the Earth with a risk of collision.     |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/256    |  Closed universe  |  A cosmological model, first formulated by Friedmann and Lemaître, in which the Universe has a finite size and lifetime and space has a positive curvature, e.g. a Universe with a density greater than the critical density.     |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/258    |  Earth's clouds   |  A visible mass of water droplets and/or ice particles in the atmosphere above the Earth's surface.   |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/263    |  Cocoon stars     |  A star hidden in a dense envelope of gas and dust which is a strong source of infrared emission.     |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/264    |  Coelostats   |  A flat mirror with a clock-drive mounted in such a way that it moves from east to west to compensate for the apparent rotation of the Earth in order that the image of a particular area of sky remains fixed in the focal plane.    |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/265    |  Cold dark matter     |  Any hypothetical non-baryonic dark matter that is non-relativistic at the point of decoupling in the early Universe. CDM plays a key role in cosmic structure formation.     |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/268    |  Collimation  |  To pack and align photons or atomic particles parallel to a particular direction.    |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/270    |  Coma Cluster     |  The nearest rich cluster of galaxies which contains more than a thousand known galaxies, is about 20 million light-years in diameter, and lies about 280 million light-years away in the constellation Coma Berenices.   |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/274    |  Comet tails  |  A formation of gas and/or dust that streams away from the coma of many comets under the influence of the Sun's radiation pressure and the solar wind.    |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/276    |  Cometary globules    |  A relatively small cloud of dust and gas in the interstellar medium shaped like a comet with a bright-rimmed head. Cometary globules are situated near young massive stars with a strong stellar wind. The wind ionizes gases on the side facing the O stars and sweep away the low-density gas toward the tail. Cometary globules are believed to be molecular cloud condensations, which are so dense that they are not disrupted when an H II region expands into the molecular cloud surrounding it. The Rosette nebula is a good example of an H II region which shows an abundance of cometary globules.   |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/280    |  Comets   |  A small body of gas and dust which revolves around the Sun in a usually very elliptical or even parabolic orbit. It is seen to be composed of a head and often with a spectacular gaseous tail extending a great distance from the head. The rocky-icy head is called the comet nucleus. As the comet nears the Sun, the increased temperature causes the ice in the nucleus to sublimate and form a gaseous halo around the nucleus, called the coma. Comets often possess two tails, a dust tail that lies in the orbit behind the comet generated by surface activity, and a brighter, ionized gas tail, that points away from the Sun, driven by solar wind. Cometary reservoirs are thought to represent primordial solar system material. A comet with a dust coating on its surface that inhibits gas production might be classified as an asteroid. Because of this ambiguity, objects such as Chiron, Centaur asteroid, have been reclassified as comets. Comets are primarily composed of amorphous water ice, but also contain carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, formaldehyde, methanol, methane at a few percent level (with respect to water), and many other molecules at a lower level.    |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/283    |  Compact binary stars     |  A binary star system which is composed of a collapsed object (degenerate dwarf, neutron star, or black hole) in orbit with a low-mass (≤ 0.5 M_sol) secondary star, wherein the collapsed star accretes matter from its companion. These two objects form a binary system of overall dimensions 10^6 km with an orbital period of only hours or less.    |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/285    |  Compact galaxies     |  A galaxy with no disk or nebulous background and a high surface brightness that appears only barely larger than a star-like point on a sky survey photograph.    |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/286    |  Compact H II region  |  A Galactic H II region with an electron density ≥ 10^3 cm^-3 and of a linear dimension ≤ 1 pc.   |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/288    |  Compact objects  |  An astronomical object that is substantially denser or more compact than most objects of its class. More specifically, a neutron star or a stellar black hole.   |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/291    |  Companion stars  |  The fainter of the two stars in a binary star system.    |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/292    |  Comparison stars     |  A non-variable star used to monitor the variations of another nearby star.   |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/295    |  Conjunction  |  A position of two bodies in the solar system when they have the same celestial longitude, seen from the Earth. The bodies can be a planet and the Sun, two planets or the Moon and a planet. The superior planets are in conjunction with the Sun, when, seen from the Earth, they are right behind the Sun. The inferior planets, such as Mercury and Venus, have two conjunctions with the Sun: inferior conjunction, when they are between the Earth and the Sun, and superior conjunction, when they are on the other side of the Sun.   |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/296    |  Constellations   |  A grouping of conspicuous stars that, when seen from Earth, form an apparent pattern. The sky is divided into 88 constellations.     |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/297    |  Contact binary stars     |  A binary star system in which the two components are so close that they exchange gases in a complex manner. Their overlapping gravitational fields form a 'peanut' shaped equipotential surface.     |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/304    |  Core-collapse supernovae     |  A supernova arising from the core collapse of a massive star.    |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/310    |  Solar coronal mass ejections     |  A huge eruption of material from regions of the solar corona in which the magnetic field is closed, but which suffer an extremely energetic disruption. Over the course of several hours up to 10,000 billion kg of this material is ejected into interplanetary space with a speed of as high as 3000 km/s. CMEs are most spectacularly observed by a white light coronagraph located outside Earth's atmosphere. Such observations from Skylab in the early 1970's were the first to reveal this phenomenon. CME's disrupt the flow of the solar wind and can produce intense electromagnetic disturbances that can severely damage satellites and disrupt power grids on Earth. When these ejections reach the Earth, they give rise to geomagnetic storms. The frequency varies with the solar cycle; during solar minimum they come at a rate of about one per week, and during maximum there is an average of about two or three per day.  |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/319    |  Cosmic inflation     |  A brief exponential expansion of the Universe postulated to have occurred 10-35 seconds after the Big Bang, in response to the separation of the strong interaction from the electroweak interaction. This idea aims at explaining the flatness problem, the horizon problem, and the magnetic monopole problem.     |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/329    |  Cosmic rays  |  Extremely energetic atomic nuclei which travel through the Universe at practically the speed of light and strike the Earth from all direction. Almost 90% of all the incoming primary cosmic rays are protons, about 9% are helium nuclei (alpha particles) and about 1% are electrons (beta minus particles). Some cosmic rays come from the Sun (mainly due to solar flares), most come from galactic supernovae, and a few with the highest energy are suspected to originate from outside the Milky Way. As for their flux, about 1 charged particle per second per cm^2 impacts the Earth. The typical kinetic energy of these particles is about 10 MeV/nucleon to several GeV/nucleon, although there are some at higher energies. In fact, the cosmic ray with the highest energy has been measured above x 10^20 eV. These ultra-high energy cosmic rays are suspected to be extragalactic, as there is no plausible mechanism of acceleration to these energies by a supernova, for example. Again, compare these energies to those of solar neutrinos that have only 0.26 MeV. Cosmic rays may be divided into primary cosmic rays and secondary cosmic rays. Their energy ranges from 10^9 to 10^20 electron-volts.  |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/330    |  Cosmic web   |  The entire, large-scale structure of the Universe in which galaxy clusters are connected by cosmic filaments (made up of dark matter and baryons) in a spongelike geometry, while the low-density voids are connected to each other by low-density tunnels.  |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/331    |  Cosmochemistry   |  The study of the chemical composition of the universe and the processes that produced those compositions. Cosmochemistry is an interdisciplinary science that overlaps with geochemistry, geology, astronomy, astrophysics, and geophysics.  |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/333    |  Cosmogony    |  A philosophical, religious, or mythical story of the creation or origin of the Universe, usually referring to the solar system.  |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/334    |  Cosmological constant    |  A term introduced by Einstein into his gravitational field equations in order to allow a solution corresponding to a static Universe. The cosmological constant is physically interpreted as due to the vacuum energy of quantized fields.   |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/343    |  Cosmology    |  The science of the origin, structure, and evolution of the Universe including the origin of galaxies, the chemical elements, and matter.     |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/348    |  DA stars     |  A white dwarf whose spectrum shows the Balmer lines of hydrogen only, with no helium or metals.  |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/350    |  Dark adaption    |  The automatic adjustment of the iris and retina of the eye to allow maximum vision in the dark, following exposure of the eye to a relatively brighter illumination.     |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/351    |  Dark energy  |  A hypothetical form of energy that fills all the space and tends to increase the rate of expansion of the Universe. Assuming the existence of dark energy is a way to explain recent observations that the Universe appears to be expanding at an increasing rate. Dark energy seems to be a kind of anti-gravity force and is supposed to be related to vacuum energy. Where gravity pulls things together at the more local level, dark energy tears them apart on the grander scale. The acceleration equation, one of Einstein's equations for the homogeneous Universe, indicates that if the Universe is accelerating, the pressure of the driving component should be strongly negative.  The first indication of dark energy was provided by the observation of Type Ia supernovae. Other probes of dark energy are: baryon acoustic oscillations, weak gravitational lensing, and clusters of galaxies. In the standard model of cosmology, dark energy currently accounts for almost 74% of the total mass-energy of the Universe. Two proposed forms for dark energy are the cosmological constant and exotic component such as quintessence.     |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/353    |  Dark matter  |  Matter that has no radiation and therefore cannot be detected directly, but whose presence can be inferred from dynamical phenomena produced by its gravitational influence. The existence of dark matter is deduced mainly from the rotational speeds of galaxies, velocities of galaxies in clusters, gravitational lensing by galaxy clusters, and the temperature distribution of hot gas in galaxies and clusters of galaxies. Dark matter plays also a central role in cosmic structure formation. There exists a large number of non-baryonic dark matter candidates. They include, the hypothetical stable particles WIMPs, neutralinos, axions, gravitinos, etc. Among unstable candidates are gravitinos with mild R-parity violation and sterile neutrinos.   |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/358    |  DB stars     |  A white dwarf whose spectrum shows strong He I in the absence of hydrogen or metal lines.    |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/361    |  de Sitter universe   |  A solution to Einstein's field equations of general relativity which contains no ordinary matter (Ω_M = 0) or radiation (Ω_R = 0), is Euclidean (k = 0), but has a cosmological constant (Ω_Λ > 0). The Universe expands exponentially forever. This solution was the first model expanding of expanding Universe.   |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/364    |  Deceleration parameter   |  A parameter designating the rate at which the expansion of the Universe would slow down owing to the braking gravitational effect of the matter content of the Universe.     |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/365    |  Declination  |  Angular distance (symbol δ) from the celestial equator. One of the coordinates, with right ascension, that defines the position of a heavenly body in the equator system. Declination is measured positively (+) north or negatively (-) south of the celestial equator from 0° to 90°.  |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/367    |  Degenerate matter    |  Highly compressed matter in which the normal atomic structure has broken down and which, because of quantum-mechanical effects, exerts a pressure that is independent of temperature. Bodies with masses less than Chandrasekhar's limit (1.4 solar masses) are supported by electron degeneracy pressure and have densities of about 10^6 kg/m^3. In collapsed stars of mass above 1.4 solar masses, gravity will overwhelm electron degeneracy and further collapse ensues. Electrons combine with protons to form neutrons, so producing a neutron star. Because neutrons, like electrons, are fermions and therefore subject to the Pauli exclusion principle, at high enough densities, about 10^14 kg/m^3, neutron degeneracy pressure prevents further collapse of the star. For masses larger than 2-3 solar masses, even neutron degeneracy cannot prevent further collapse, and a black hole is formed.    |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/368    |  Delta Cepheid variable stars     |  The prototype of classical Cepheid variables, which is a pulsating yellow supergiant. John Goodricke was the first in 1784 to discover its variability. The star shows a quick and sharp rise from minimum to maximum, and slowly declines to its minimum again. The changes in brightness are accompanied by and principally caused by changes in stellar temperature and also by changes in radius. δ Cephei was actually the second Cepheid variable to be discovered. The first one, Eta Aquilae, had been discovered earlier the same year by Edward Pigott. δ Cephei varies with a period of 5.366341 days (or 5 days 8 hours 37.5 minutes) from magnitude 3.48, spectral type F5 Ib in its maximum to magnitude 4.37, spectral type G2 Ib in its minimum. It lies at a distance of 1,340 light-years.     |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/370    |  Delta Scuti variable stars   |  A member of a class of pulsating stars with periods less than 0.3 days, spectral types A or F, and visual light amplitudes in the range from a few thousands of a magnitude to about 0.8 mag. On the H-R diagram, δ Scuti stars form a group which lies in an instability strip which includes the classical Cepheids at its brightest end and the pulsating white dwarfs at its faintest limit. These stars can show very complex light variations since, while some of them are pulsating in one radial mode only, others may be pulsating simultaneously in several radial and non-radial modes.  |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/374    |  Descending node  |  The point in an orbit where the orbiting body crosses a reference plane, such as the ecliptic or the celestial equator, going from north to south.   |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/375    |  Detached binary stars    |  A binary star system whose components are not in contact and in which no significant mass exchange is occurring.     |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/378    |  Diamond ring effect  |  An intense flash of light that happens a few seconds before and after totality during a solar eclipse. The effect is caused by the last rays of sunlight before totality (or the first rays of sunlight after totality) shining through valleys on the edge of the Moon.     |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/379    |  Diffuse interstellar bands   |  Absorption features in the spectrum of stars identified in the ultraviolet, visible, and infrared regions. They have an interstellar origin, but despite extensive efforts, their carrier(s) have not yet been clearly identified.   |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/380    |  Diffuse interstellar clouds  |  An interstellar cloud in which hydrogen is completely dissociated and which is less dense and dusty than molecular clouds. In diffuse interstellar clouds photoabsorption of the background ultraviolet (UV) radiation field is an important dissociating and ionizing process. Typical densities and temperatures of diffuse clouds are 10^2 to 10^3 cm^-3 and 20 to 100 K respectively. Because of modest extinctions (≤ 1 mag), photodissociation processes are important in diffuse clouds preventing the formation of larger molecules.     |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/381    |  Diffuse molecular clouds     |  A type of molecular cloud in which the interstellar radiation field is sufficiently attenuated, so that the local fraction of molecular hydrogen becomes substantial (> 0.1). However, enough interstellar radiation is still present to photoionize any atomic carbon, or to photodissociate carbon monoxide (CO) such that carbon is predominantly still in the form of C+ (> 0.5). In steady state, diffuse molecular clouds must necessarily be surrounded by diffuse atomic gas, in order to provide the shielding of radiation. This means that most sightlines that cross a diffuse molecular cloud will also cross diffuse atomic gas.   |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/382    |  Diffuse nebulae  |  An irregularly shaped and low density interstellar cloud visible in the optical wavelengths.     |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/388    |  Dirty snowball model     |  A model for a cometary nucleus proposed by Fred Whipple (1950-51), according to which the nucleus is a solid body (a few kilometers across) made up of various ices (frozen water, methane, ammonia, carbon dioxide, and hydrogen cyanide) in which dust is embedded. Dust particles are liberated when the ices vaporize as the comet approaches the Sun, and they get blown away by solar radiation pressure, often forming impressive, gently curved dust tails.  |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/391    |  Disk galaxies    |  A galaxy consisting of a thin disk of stars and interstellar matter which may include spiral arms and bar.   |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/396    |  Diurnal parallax     |  The apparent difference between the position of a celestial object measured from the Earth's surface and the position that would be recorded by a hypothetical observer at the center of the Earth.  |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/397    |  DO stars     |  A white dwarf whose spectrum shows strong lines of singly ionized helium He II; He I or H may be present. As a DO star cools, the He II will recombine with free electrons to form He I, eventually changing the DO type into a DB white dwarf.  |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/399    |  Domes    |  A vault, having a circular plan and usually in the form of a portion of a sphere, that shelters an optical telescope.    |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/401    |  Doppler shift    |  Effect of the relative motion of a wave source (light, sound) and the observer. If the source is moving away, the wavelength is stretched (shifted toward lower frequencies). If the source is approaching, the wavelength is compressed (shifted toward higher frequencies). These effects, known as Doppler shifts, are in the case of light waves called redshift and blueshift, respectively.    |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/407    |  DQ Herculis stars    |  A type of cataclysmic variable binary star system with a white dwarf and a cool main-sequence secondary star.    |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/408    |  Draco dwarf galaxy   |  A dwarf elliptical galaxy that is a satellite of our Galaxy and lies at a distance of about 250,000 light-years from the Galactic center. Its diameter is only about 3,500 light-years, and its absolute magnitude -8.6, making it the least luminous galaxy known.  |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/409    |  Dredge-up    |  A process by which the nucleosynthesis products inside a star are drawn to upper layers of the star.     |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/415    |  Dwarf elliptical galaxies    |  A galaxy that is much smaller than other members of the elliptical class; it is designated as dE. A subtype of dwarf ellipticals is called a dwarf spheroidal galaxy (dSph). The basic characteristics of the class are low surface brightness and smooth light distribution. They range in luminosity from that of the faintest dSph galaxies M_V ~ -9 to about -17. In the Local Group there are 19 known dEs. They are very common in galaxy clusters.    |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/416    |  Dwarf galaxies   |  A small, low luminosity galaxy that is associated with a larger spiral galaxy and may make up part of a galactic halo. There are many of them in the Local Group, and often orbit around larger galaxies such as the Milky Way and the Andromeda Galaxy. There are three main types of them: dwarf elliptical galaxy (dE), dwarf irregular galaxy (dI), and dwarf spiral galaxy (dSA).   |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/417    |  Dwarf irregular galaxies     |  An irregular galaxy that is much smaller than other irregulars. Dwarf irregulars are generally metal poor and have relatively high fractions of gas. They are thought to be similar to the earliest galaxies that populated the Universe, and are therefore important to understand the overall evolution of galaxies.   |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/418    |  Dwarf novae  |  A class of novae and cataclysmic variables that have multiple observed eruptions. Their prototype is U Geminorum star. Optically, dwarf nova eruptions have amplitudes of 2-6 mag in V, a duration of a few to 20 days and a recurrence time-scale of weeks to years. Dwarf novae are thought to be semidetached binary stars consisting of a white dwarf primary accreting via Roche lobe overflow from a companion which is usually a late-type, generally main-sequence star. DN outbursts are usually attributed to the release of gravitational energy resulting from an instability in the accretion disk or by sudden mass transfers through the disk.    |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/419    |  Dwarf planets    |  A new category of astronomical objects in the solar system introduced in a resolution by the 26th General Assembly of the International Astronomical Union (IAU) on August 24, 2006. The characterizing properties are as follows: 1) It is in orbit around the Sun; 2) It has sufficient mass for its self-gravity to overcome rigid body forces so that it assumes a hydrostatic equilibrium (nearly round) shape; 3) It has not 'cleared the neighbourhood' around its orbit; and 4) It is not a satellite of a planet, or other non-stellar body. The property 3 reclassified Pluto from a planet to a dwarf planet because it has not cleared the neighborhood of its orbit (the Kuiper Belt). The largest known dwarf planets are: Eris, Pluto, Ceres, Makemake, and 2015 RR245.   |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/420    |  Dwarf spheroidal galaxies    |  A subtype of dwarf ellipticals (dwarf elliptical galaxy), which are companion to the Milky Way and other similar galaxies. The first example of such objects was discovered by Harlow Shapley (1938) in the constellation Sculptor. 22 such galaxies are known currently to orbit the Milky Way and at least 36 exist in the Local Group of galaxies. Nearby galaxy clusters such as the Virgo, Fornax, Centaurus, and Coma clusters contain hundreds to thousands of individual dSph galaxies. These galaxies have very low surface brightnesses, as low as only 1% that of the sky background. They are also among the smallest, least luminous galaxies known. Most of the radiation from dSph galaxies is emitted by stars in the optical portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. The lack of strong emission lines, infrared, or radio emission suggests that these galaxies are generally devoid of interstellar medium. The velocities of stars within dSph galaxies are so high that them must be disrupting. However, the bulk of mass in these galaxies might be undetected. Dynamical models that include dark matter do adequately explain the velocity dispersion of the stars in all dSph systems. In the most extreme cases, only 1% of the mass of the galaxy is visible. Many of the Local Group dSph galaxies show evidence for star formation more recent than 10 Gyr.   |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/422    |  Dynamical friction   |  The gravitational interaction between a relatively massive body and a field of much less massive bodies through which the massive body travels. As a result, the moving body loses momentum and kinetic energy. An example of dynamical friction is the sinking of massive stars to the center of a star cluster, a process called mass segregation. Dynamical friction plays an important role in stellar dynamics. It was first quantified by Chandrasekhar (1943).    |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/423    |  Dynamical parallax   |  A method for deriving the distance to a binary star. The angular diameter of the orbit of the stars around each other and their apparent brightness are observed. By applying Kepler's laws and the mass-luminosity relation, the distance of the binary star can be calculated.     |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/424    |  E+A galaxies     |  E+A galaxies have strong Balmer absorption lines typical of young stars, but lack optical emission features (e.g. O III 5007) typical of star-forming regions and have metallic absorption lines (e.g. Ca H and K) indicative of an older population of dwarf stars. The presence of two distinct stellar populations and morphological observations suggest that E+A galaxies are the product of a gas-rich galaxy merger.  |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/425    |  E-folding time   |  The time within which the amplitude of an oscillation increases or decreases by a factor e (= 2.71828...).   |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/429    |  Early-type galaxies  |  In the Hubble classification, galaxies on the left part of the Hubble sequence. Early-type galaxies tend to have redder colors, higher average surface brightnesses, and lower neutral hydrogen content than late-type galaxies. This terminology is based on the obsolete and erroneous idea that elliptical and lenticular galaxies might be evolutionary precursors to spiral and barred spiral galaxies.     |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/430    |  Early-type stars     |  Hot, luminous stars of spectral type O, B, A, and F0 to F5. They were originally thought, wrongly, to be at an earlier stage of evolution than late-type stars.  |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/435    |  Early universe   |  A qualitative term used to describe a phase in the history of the Universe, from the Big Bang event to the apparition of the first structures (seeds of future galaxies), at a redshift around 30.   |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/436    |  Earth-moon system    |  A physical system composed on the Earth and the Moon in which both objects directly influence each other. The total energy in the Earth-Moon system is conserved. The most notable influence that the two objects have on each other is tides.   |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/439    |  Earth (planet)   |  The third planet from the Sun. At perihelion, it is 147,099,590 km from the Sun, and at aphelion it is 152,096.150 km, whereas its mean distance from the Sun (astronomical unit) is 149,598 x 10^6 km. Its orbital period is 365.2563 days (sidereal year) and its eccentricity 0.017. Other characteristics: axial inclination 23.44°; rotation period 23.934 h (sidereal day); mean density 5.52 g/cm^3; mass 5.974 x 10^24 kg; escape velocity 11.18 km/s; average albedo 0.37.  The Earth's atmosphere consists of 78% nitrogen, 21% oxygen and 0.9% argon, plus carbon dioxide, hydrogen, and other gases in much smaller quantities. The atmospheric pressure at sea level is about 1,000 mbar. The surface average temperature is 15° C, but it varies, on the average, between -50° C (winter, Siberia) and up to + 40° C (summer, Sahara).  Liquid water covers 71% of the surface. Over 5,000 active volcanoes have been registered throughout man's known history. The outer layer of the planet, the lithosphere, is covered with the crust. In the upper mantle and beneath the lithosphere, lies asthenosphere. Convection in the asthenosphere has caused plate tectonics motions and continent drifts. The densest layer of the Earth is its core, about 3000 km to 6400 km beneath the surface, consisting primarily of iron and nickel. This core is believed to be at the origin of the magnetic field, which reaches about 3 x 10^-5 tesla near the equator. It has only one natural satellite, the Moon.   |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/440    |  Eccentric anomaly    |  Of a planetary orbit, the angle measured from the perihelion position, to the center of the circumscribing auxiliary circle, to the projected position of the planet on the circle.  |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/441    |  Eccentricity     |  The amount by which the orbit deviates from circularity: e = c/a, where c is the distance from the center to a focus and a the semi-major axis. If e = 0, the orbit is a circle. If e < 1, the orbit is an ellipse, if e > 1 it is a hyperbola, and if e = 1 it is a parabola. The eccentricity is one of the six orbital elements that define a Keplerian orbit.    |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/442    |  Eclipses     |  The passage of the shadow of a celestial body over the surface of another. The maximum number of solar and lunar visible eclipses occurring annually is seven; the minimum number is two, both being solar. Solar eclipses take place when the new Moon is close to an orbital node and on the same longitude with the Sun. At that moment either the umbra, antumbra, or the penumbra touches the Earth's surface. For an observer located in the umbra the eclipse is total, while for one placed in the antumbra it is annular. Annular eclipses occur around lunar apogee. An observer situated in the penumbra sees only a partial eclipse. A total or annular eclipse can be seen from a band with a width of 270 km at the most, around which, the much larger partiality zone extends. The Moon's shadow crosses the Earth from west to east at about 3,200 km/h. During total eclipses the Sun's disk is entirely covered and the solar corona can be seen. A solar eclipse can last up to 3h (between the first and the fourth contacts). Totality has a theoretical maximum duration of 7m 31s, but it is usually shorter. A lunar eclipse can be seen from any place on Earth where the Moon is above the horizon; it occurs when the full Moon passes through the central dark shadow of the Earth. The Earth's shadow is much wider than the Moon and this is why the lunar eclipses can last up to four hours (between the first and the fourth contact).     |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/444    |  Eclipsing binary stars   |  A binary star in which one of the two stars passes in front of the other so that the system's total light periodically fades. The most famous eclipsing binary is Algol.     |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/445    |  Ecliptic coordinate system   |  Coordinate system with the ecliptic as the fundamental plane.    |

|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/448    |  Ecliptic poles   |  Either of the two points on the celestial sphere that are 90° above and below the plane of ecliptic. The north ecliptic pole lies in Draco, and the south ecliptic pole in Dorado. Due to precession, the celestial pole moves in a circle around the ecliptic poles once every 25,800 years.    |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/449    |  Effective temperature    |  A measure of the surface temperature of a star derived from the total emitted energy, assuming that the star is a blackbody emitter.     |

|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/456    |  Elliptical galaxies  |  A galaxy whose structure is smooth without spiral arms and ellipsoidal in shape. Ellipticals are redder than spirals of similar mass. Giant ellipticals contain over 1012 solar masses, whereas dwarf ellipticals have masses as low as 107 solar masses.    |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/461    |  Emission nebulae     |  An ionized nebula whose spectrum consists of emission lines.     |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/464    |  Ephemerides  |  A table of computed positions occupied by a celestial body over successive intervals of time such as daily; plural ephemerides.  |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/467    |  Equatorial coordinate system     |  An astronomical coordinate system for indicating the positions of celestial objects on the celestial sphere. The system consists of two components, right ascension and declination. Right ascension is the angle between the vernal equinox and the point where the hour circle intersects the celestial equator. The right ascension is always measured eastward from the vernal equinox, in the units of hours, minutes, and seconds. Declination is the angle between the celestial equator and the position of the star measured along the star's hour circle. It is measured in degrees, minutes, and seconds north or south of the celestial equator. By definition, the vernal equinox is located at right ascension 0h and declination 0°. Equatorial coordinates change with time due to the precession of the Earth's rotation axis.  |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/468    |  Equatorial mounts    |  A telescope mounting consisting of a polar axis pointed toward the celestial pole, and a declination axis supporting the instrument at right angles to the polar axis.   |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/470    |  Equinox  |  One of the two points on the celestial sphere where the celestial equator intersects the ecliptic, that is when the apparent ecliptic longitude of the Sun is 0° or 180°.  At equinox, the length of the day and the night are equal all over the globe. The equinox is not a fixed point; it moves due to precession and nutation. If only precession is considered, we deal with the mean equinox of date. If nutation is also taken into account, then we are concerned with the true equinox.    |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/472    |  Ergosphere   |  The region between the event horizon and the stationary limit of a rotating Kerr black hole. It is possible for a particle falling inside the ergosphere to break into two parts, one of which will fall into the black hole and the other will come out.    |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/477    |  Ethnoastronomy   |  The study of the beliefs, interpretations, and practices of specific cultures regarding celestial objects or phenomena. Ethnoastronomy uses the tools and methodologies of ethnology in the study of astronomical conceptions.   |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/479    |  Event horizons   |  The surface surrounding a black hole with the property that any light ray emitted inside it cannot escape to the outer space because of the strength of the gravitational field. The radius of the event horizon is called the Schwarzschild radius.     |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/481    |  Evolved stars    |  A star that has left the main sequence.  |

|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/484    |  Exoplanet systems    |  A planetary system consisting of exoplanets orbiting a star other than Sun.  |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/498    |  Exoplanets   |  A planet which belongs to a star other than Sun, and therefore does not belong to our solar system; same as exoplanet.   |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/499    |  Exosphere    |  The outermost portion of the Earth's atmosphere. Extremely tenuous, it lies above the ionosphere from a height of about 500 km, to the edge of interplanetary space. Since the mean free path is much greater than the atmospheric scale height, the atoms or molecules never collide with each other.   |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/502    |  Expanding universe   |  The deduction based on the observational fact that the greater the distance to a galaxy, the greater the redshift in its spectral lines (Doppler effect). The observations strongly indicate that galaxies appear to be moving away from us with speeds proportional to their distance. This is in agreement with the overall expansion of the Universe.     |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/503    |  Explosive nucleosynthesis    |  The explosive processes that are believed to occur in supernovae. Explosive carbon burning occurs at a temperature of about 2 x 10^9 degrees and produces the nuclei from neon to silicon. Explosive oxygen burning occurs near 4 x 10^9 degrees and produces nuclei between silicon and calcium in atomic weight. At higher temperatures, still heavier nuclei are produced.    |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/505    |  Extinction   |  Dimming of light by an intervening medium (the Earth's atmosphere or the interstellar medium). It is usually due to both scattering and absorption.  |

|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/514    |  Extrinsic variable stars     |  A star whose variation in apparent brightness is not due to changes in the star itself but to some external cause, such as eclipsing by a companion.     |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/526    |  Fanaroff-Riley radio galaxies    |  Analyzing a sample of 57 radio galaxies from the 3CR catalogue, which were clearly resolved at 1.4 GHz or 5 GHz, Fanaroff & Riley (1974) discovered that the relative positions of regions of high and low surface brightness in the lobes of extragalactic radio sources are correlated with their radio luminosity. They divided the sample into two classes using the ratio RFR of the distance between the regions of highest surface brightness on opposite sides of the central galaxy or quasar, to the total extent of the source up to the lowest brightness contour in the map. Fanaroff-Riley Class I (FR-I) , Fanaroff-Riley Class II (FR-II). The boundary between the two classes is not very sharp, and there is some overlap in the luminosities of sources classified as FR-I or FR-II on the basis of their structures. The physical cause of the FR-I/II dichotomy probably lies in the type of flow in the radio jets.   |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/532    |  Solar fibrils    |  A linear pattern in the chromosphere of the Sun, as seen through an H-alpha filter, occurring near strong sunspots and plages or in filament channels. They are magnetically confined tubes of hot plasma. Individually, they are about 10,000 km long and last for 10 to 20 minutes.    |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/533    |  Field galaxies   |  A galaxy that lies in the direction of a cluster of galaxies, but is not a member of the cluster. Field galaxies are rare, less than about 5% of all galaxies.   |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/534    |  Field of view    |  The entire angular expanse of the sky viewed by an optical instrument.   |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/535    |  Filamentary nebulae  |  A type of nebula, generally ionized, consisting of filament-like structures of gas, such as the Veil Nebula (NGC 6960) or the supernova remnant IC 443.  |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/536    |  Finding charts   |  A sketch or image used to recognize objects in the field of view of a telescope.     |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/540    |  Flare stars  |  A member of a class of dwarf stars that undergoes sudden, intense outbursts of light (mean amplitude about 0.5-0.6 mag).     |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/541    |  Flash spectra    |  The spectrum of the solar chromosphere obtained during a solar eclipse in the instant before or after totality. In the flash spectrum the usual solar absorption lines are replaced with bright emission lines. This is because in that very short interval only the photosphere is eclipsed by the Moon, and not the chromosphere. The American astronomer Charles A. Young was the first to observe it during the solar eclipse of 1870 (December 22) in Spain.    |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/544    |  Flux calibration     |  The calibration of the flux received by a detector in terms of absolute units.   |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/545    |  Flyby missions   |  A mission in which a trajectory takes a space probe close to a Solar System body (planet, satellite, asteroid, comet) but does not permit it to enter an orbit about the body.   |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/549    |  Free floating planets    |  A population of substellar objects which are not bound to stars; they are detected in young star clusters. Their masses, estimated from their fluxes, is several Jupiter masses, lower than those of brown dwarfs. Their formation is not yet explained. Among the envisaged possibilities: 1) These objects form like stars, from protostellar core collapse and subsequent accretion; 2) they form as low-mass members of small groups, and are ejected from the group; 3) they form like planets within circumstellar disks of higher-mass objects, but are ejected either due to internal dynamics or external interactions.     |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/558    |  G stars  |  A member of a class of stars to which the Sun belongs. The G-type stars on the main sequence have surface temperatures of 5,300-6,000 K and therefore appear yellow in color. G type giant stars (such as Capella) are almost 100-500 K colder than the corresponding main sequence stars. G type supergiants have temperatures of 4,500-5,500 K. The spectrum of early type G stars, such as the Sun (G2), is dominated by ionized lines of calcium (H and K lines, mainly) and neutral metals. In later type G stars the molecular bands of CH molecules and CN molecules become visible. The main sequence and giant stars have masses of ~ 1 solar mass, while the supergiants are of ~ 10 solar masses. The luminosities of G-type giants are almost 30-60 times greater than that of the Sun, whereas the supergiants are 10,000-30,000 times more luminous.   |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/564    |  Galactic anticenter  |  The point in the Galactic plane that lies directly opposite the Galactic center. It lies in the constellation Auriga at approximately R.A. 05h 46m, Dec. +28° 56'.   |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/565    |  Galactic center  |  The rotational center of the Milky Way galaxy located in the direction of the Sagittarius constellation at a distance of 7.62 ± 0.32 kpc. Its equatorial coordinates (J2000 epoch) are: R.A. 17h45m40.04s, Dec. -29° 00' 28.1''. The Sun orbits around the Galactic center once every 200 million years at a speed of 220 km per second. It is believed that there is a supermassive black hole at the Galactic center.  |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/568    |  Galactic latitude    |  In the Galactic coordinate system, the angle between the line of sight to an object and the Galactic equator. Galactic latitude ranges from +90 degrees to -90 degrees.  |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/569    |  Galactic longitude   |  In the Galactic coordinate system, the angle between the Galactic Center and the projection of the object on the Galactic plane. Galactic longitude ranges from 0 degrees to 360 degrees.    |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/573    |  Galaxies     |  Generally, a large body of gas, dust, and stars held together by their mutual gravitational attraction and ranging in mass from about 10^6 to 10^13 M_sun. If a galaxy also contains dark matter its mass will be much larger. Galaxies are grouped into three main categories: spiral galaxies, elliptical galaxies, and irregular galaxies.    |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/578    |  Galaxy bulges    |  A spheroidal region at the center of a spiral galaxy which mostly contains old stars. Galactic bulges are generally classified into two types: classical bulges and pseudo-bulges.   |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/584    |  Galaxy clusters  |  An aggregation of galaxies, made up of a few to a few thousand members, which may or may not be held together by its own gravity.    |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/595    |  Galaxy formation     |  The study dealing with the processes that gave rise to galaxies in a remarkably early Universe.  |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/626    |  Galaxy winds     |  An outflow of hot gas, analogous to the solar wind, from a galaxy that has recently undergone a high burst of star formation or has an active galactic nucleus. Galaxy winds are streams of high speed charged particles blowing out of galaxies with speeds of 300 to 3,000 km s^-1. In the case of starbursts, galactic winds are powered by stellar winds driven by massive stars and supernova explosions. Galaxy winds contain a mixture of extremely hot metal-enriched supernova ejecta and cooler entrained gas and dust. Outflowing material has been observed at great distances from galaxies (10 to 100 kpc). In some cases they escape the galaxy potential well and pollute the intergalactic medium with heavy elements. A prominent example is the superwind of the starburst galaxy M82.    |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/627    |  Galilean satellites  |  The four largest and brightest satellites of Jupiter, that is: Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto.   |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/628    |  Gamma-ray astronomy  |  The study of gamma rays from extraterrestrial sources, especially gamma-ray bursts.  |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/629    |  Gamma-ray bursts     |  An intense discharge of gamma rays, which range in duration from tenth of a second to tens of seconds and occur from sources widely distributed over the sky. The radio wave afterglow from the burst can last more than a year, making long-term observations of the sources possible. The favored hypothesis is that they are produced by a relativistic jet created by the merger of two compact objects (specifically two neutron stars or a neutron star and a black hole). Mergers of this kind are also expected to create significant quantities of neutron-rich radioactive species, whose decay should result in a faint transient, known as a kilonova, in the days following the burst. Indeed, it is speculated that this mechanism may be the predominant source of stable r-process elements in the Universe. Recent calculations suggest that much of the kilonova energy should appear in the near-infrared spectral range, because of the high optical opacity created by these heavy r-process elements.  |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/633    |  Gamma-ray sources    |  An astronomical object that emits gamma rays.    |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/637    |  Gamma-rays   |  An electromagnetic wave with a typical wavelength less than 10^-2 Å (10^-12 m), corresponding to frequencies above 10^19 Hz and photon energies above 100 keV.   |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/638    |  Gas-to-dust ratio    |  The mass ratio of gas to dust. It amounts to approximately 100 in the interstellar medium, but may vary in molecular clouds and circumstellar disks due to dust grain evaporation, dust settling, condensation of gas, etc. The gas-to-dust ratio depends on the metallicity. It is larger in galaxies with lower metallicity.   |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/639    |  Gaseous nebulae  |  An H II region, a planetary nebula, or a supernova remnant.  |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/640    |  Gegenschein  |  A faint glow of light in the night sky seen exactly opposite the Sun. The gegenschein is sunlight back-scattered off millimeter-sized dust particles along the ecliptic. In comparison with zodiacal light (forward-scattered sunlight), which is triangular in shape and found near the horizon, the gegenschein is roughly circular.   |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/641    |  General relativity   |  The theory of gravitation developed by Albert Einstein (1916) that describes the gravitation as the space-time curvature caused by the presence of matter or energy. Mass creates a gravitational field which distorts the space and changes the flow of time. In other words, mass causes a deviation of the metric of space-time continuum from that of the 'flat' space-time structure described by the Euclidean geometry and treated in special relativity. General relativity developed from the principle of equivalence between gravitational and inertial forces. According to general relativity, photons follow a curved path in a gravitational field. This prediction was confirmed by the measurements of star positions near the solar limb during the total eclipse of 1919. The same effect is seen in the delay of radio signals coming from distant space probes when grazing the Sun's surface. Moreover, the space curvature caused by the Sun makes the perihelion of Mercury's orbit advance by 43'' per century more than that predicted by Newton's theory of gravitation. The perihelion advance can reach several degrees per year for binary pulsar orbits. Another effect predicted by general relativity is the gravitational reddening. This effect is verified in the redshift of spectral lines in the solar spectrum and, even more obviously, in white dwarfs. Other predictions of the theory include gravitational lensing, gravitational waves, and the invariance of Newton's gravitational constant.     |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/644    |  Geocorona    |  The outermost part of Earth's atmosphere, a tenuous halo of hydrogen and some helium extending out to perhaps 15 Earth radii, which emits Lyman-alpha radiation when it is bombarded by sunlight.    |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/645    |  Geodesics    |  The shortest distance between two points in space (or space-time). A geodesic on a sphere is an arc of a great circle. In the theory of general relativity, freely falling bodies follow geodesic paths in space-time.   |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/647    |  Geostationary satellites     |  A satellite that orbits in the plane of the Earth's equator and 35,880 km above it, at which distance the satellite's period of rotation matches the Earth's and the satellite always remains fixed in the same spot over the Earth.     |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/648    |  Geosynchronous satellites    |  A satellite that has a circular orbit around the Earth identical to a geostationary orbit except that the satellite's orbit does not necessarily lie in the Earth's equatorial plane.    |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/650    |  Giant branch     |  A conspicuous family of stars in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram composed of red, evolved stars with large sizes.    |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/653    |  Giant molecular clouds   |  A massive complex of interstellar gas and dust, consisting mostly of molecular hydrogen, that typically stretches over 150 light-years and contains several hundred thousand solar masses. Giant molecular clouds are the principal sites of star formation.     |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/655    |  Giant stars  |  A high-luminosity star that has evolved off the main sequence and lies above the main sequence on the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. A member of the giant branch.     |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/656    |  Globular star clusters   |  A spherical aggregate of stars made up of thousands to a few million stars which is an orbiting satellite of a galaxy. There are over 150 globular clusters orbiting our galaxy. Globular clusters are gravitationally bound systems, highly concentrated to the center (up to a few 10^3 stars per cubic light-years), with a volume ranging from a few dozen up to more than 300 light-years in diameter. They are generally old and metal-poor and are among the first objects to be formed in a galaxy. There is also strong evidence that they form in major galaxy interactions and mergers. The stars in a globular cluster are thought to have a common origin and thus a single age and chemical abundance; with some exceptions such as Omega Centauri and NGC 2808, which exhibit multiple populations. The presence of various sub-populations within a globular cluster is interpreted as indicating distinct epochs of mass accretion and/or major star formation. The Milky Way hosts about 200 globular clusters. They are spherically distributed about the Galactic Center up to a radius of 350 light-years, with a maximum concentration toward the Galactic center. All but the smallest dwarf galaxies possess globular clusters. Some galaxies, e.g. M87, contain several thousands of them. There are, however, important differences. While all the globular clusters in our Galaxy and in M31 are old (ages of about 10 billion years, at least), there are galaxies, such as the two Magellanic Clouds and M33, that host much younger globular clusters (ages of a few billion years, or less).  |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/661    |  Gravitation  |  The universal phenomenon of attraction between material bodies.  |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/662    |  Gravitational collapse   |  Collapse of a mass of material as a result of the mutual gravitational attraction of all its constituents.   |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/665    |  Gravitational energy     |  The energy that an object possesses because of its position in a gravitational field, especially an object near the surface of the Earth where the gravitational acceleration can be assumed to be constant, at about 9.8 m s^-2.    |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/666    |  Gravitational equilibrium    |  The condition in a celestial body when gravitational forces acting on each point are balanced by some outward pressure, such as radiation pressure or electron degeneracy pressure, so that no vertical motion results.  |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/667    |  Gravitational fields     |  The region of space in which gravitational attraction exists.    |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/668    |  Gravitational instability    |  The process by which fluctuations in an infinite medium of size greater than a certain length scale (the Jeans length) grow by self-gravitation.     |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/669    |  Gravitational interaction    |  Mutual attraction between any two bodies that have mass.     |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/670    |  Gravitational lensing    |  A concentration of matter, such as a galaxy or a cluster of galaxies, that bends light rays from a background object, resulting in production of multiple images. If the two objects and the Earth are perfectly aligned, the light from the distant object appears as a ring from Earth. This is called an Einstein Ring, since its existence was predicted by Einstein in his theory of general relativity.    |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/678    |  Gravitational waves  |  A space-time oscillation created by the motion of matter, as predicted by Einstein's general relativity. When an object accelerates, it creates ripples in space-time, just like a boat causes ripples in a lake. Gravitational waves are extremely weak even for the most massive objects like supermassive black holes. They had been inferred from observing a binary pulsar in which the components slow down, due to losing energy from emitting gravitational waves. Gravitational waves were directly detected for the first time on September 14, 2015 by the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO). Since then several other events have been detected by LIGO and Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA).  |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/680    |  Gravity darkening    |  The darkening, or brightening, of a region on a star due to localized decrease, or increase, in the effective gravity. Gravity darkening is explained by the von Zeipel theorem, whereby on stellar surface the radiative flux is proportional to the effective gravity. This means that in rotating stars regions close to the pole are brighter (and have higher temperature) than regions close to the equator. Gravity darkening occurs also in corotating binary systems, where the tidal force leads to both gravity darkening and gravity brightening. The effects are often seen in binary star light curves. Recent theoretical work has shown that gravity darkening is not well represented by the von Zeipel theorem. This is supported by new interferometric observations of some rapidly rotating stars indicating that the von Zeipel theorem seems to overestimate the temperature difference between the poles and equator.    |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/682    |  Great Attractor  |  A hypothesized large concentration of mass (about 10^16  solar masses), some hundred million light-years from Earth, in the direction of the Centaurus supercluster, that seems to be affecting the motions of many nearby galaxies by virtue of its gravity.    |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/684    |  Greenhouse gases     |  Gases responsible for the greenhouse effect. These gases include: water vapor; carbon dioxide; methane; nitrous oxide; chlorofluorocarbons; and tropospheric ozone.  |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/686    |  Ground-based astronomy   |  Astronomical study carried out using a telescope on Earth, as opposed to that from an orbiting satellite.    |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/693    |  H I regions  |  A region of neutral (atomic) hydrogen in interstellar space. At least 95 percent of interstellar hydrogen is H I. It emits radio waves that are 21 cm long.  |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/694    |  H II regions     |  A type of emission nebulae composed of very hot gas (about 10^4 K), mainly ionized hydrogen, created by the ultraviolet radiation of massive stars. H II regions originate when O or early-type stars, born in giant molecular clouds, start heating up the cold gas, causing it to become ionized and 'glow'. The effective temperatures of the exciting stars are in the range 3 x 10^4 to 5 x 10^4 K, and throughout the nebula hydrogen is ionized. Helium is singly ionized, and other elements are mostly singly or doubly ionized. Typical densities in the H II region are of the order 10 to 10^2 cm^-3, ranging as high as 10^4 cm^-3. Internal motions occur in the gas with velocities of order 10 km s^-1. The spectra of H II regions are mainly composed of strong H I recombination lines and forbidden lines such as [O III], [O II], [N II].   |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/696    |  Habitable zone   |  A zone around a star where the temperature would be in the range 0-100 °C to sustain liquid water on the surface of rocky planets (or sufficiently large moons). Water is thought to be a necessary component to the formation and evolution of Earth-type life. This zone depends on the parent star's luminosity and distance; it will be farther from hotter stars. A more accurate definition of a Habitable Zone needs to include other factors, such as orbital eccentricity, heat sources other than stellar irradiation, and atmospheric properties.     |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/701    |  Haro galaxies    |  A type of galaxies characterized by strong emission in the blue and violet regions of the spectrum. They are often elliptical or lenticular.     |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/703    |  Hawking radiation    |  The radiation produced by a black hole when quantum mechanical effects are taken into account. According to quantum physics, large fluctuations in the vacuum energy occurs for brief moments of time. Thereby virtual particle-antiparticle pairs are created from vacuum and annihilated. If pair production happens just outside the event horizon of a black hole, as soon as these particles are formed they would both experience drastically different gravitational attractions due to the sharp gradient of force close to the black hole. One particle will accelerate toward the black hole and its partner will escape into space. The black hole used some of its gravitational energy to produce these two particles, so it loses some of its mass if a particle escapes. This gradual loss of mass over time means the black hole eventually evaporates out of existence.     |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/704    |  Hayashi track    |  The path on the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram that is followed by a fully convective pre-main sequence star to reach the zero-age main sequence. Hayashi tracks for low-mass stars are near vertical. At higher masses, stars become increasingly radiative as they contract and the Hayashi tracks are almost horizontal.     |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/707    |  Heliopause   |  The edge of the solar system where the pressure of the solar wind balances that of the interstellar medium plasma. In other words, the surface boundary that separates the heliosphere from interstellar space. It is estimated to be situated 100 astronomical units or more from the Sun. A bow shock likely forms as the interstellar medium wind approaches the heliosphere and is deflected around the heliosphere, forcing it into a teardrop-shaped structure with a long, comet-like tail.   |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/709    |  Helioseismology  |  The branch of astrophysics that investigates the interior structure of the Sun by studying its surface wave oscillations.  The surface of the Sun vibrates much like a bell. A piano has 88 keys or musical tones, whereas the Sun has millions of notes. These vibrations are the result of internal pressure waves that reflect off the photosphere and repeatedly cross the solar interior. They are detected through the Doppler shift of absorption lines formed in the photosphere. Because these vibrations make the solar surface move up and down, analysis of the surface patterns is used to study conditions far below the Sun's surface. The mean period of the vibrations is about five minutes, which corresponds to a frequency of about 3 mHz.  |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/710    |  Heliosheath  |  The region located between the termination shock and the heliopause where the turbulent and hot solar wind is compressed as it passes outward against the interstellar wind.     |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/711    |  Heliosphere  |  The vast, three-dimensional region of space around the Sun filled with the solar wind and the remnant of the solar magnetic field carried in it. It is bounded by the heliopause, which is estimated to be 100 astronomical units or more from the Sun. The radius of the heliosphere is expected to vary with the solar cycle. The heliosphere may be very elongated owing to the presence of an interstellar wind of neutral hydrogen flowing from the direction of the Galactic center.   |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/712    |  Heliostats   |  An instrument consisting of a mirror moved by clockwork for tracking the movement of the Sun and reflecting the sunlight into a stationary solar telescope. A heliostat is similar to a coelostat.   |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/716    |  Helium burning   |  The stage in the evolution of a star, after the exhaustion of hydrogen, when the star produces its energy by the fusion of helium into carbon and oxygen.    |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/717    |  Helium-weak stars    |  Chemically peculiar stars with very weak helium lines. Examples include 3 Sco, HD 176582, HD 217833, HR 2949, and HD 21699. The He-weak stars do not form a homogeneous group. Some of them display intense Si, or Ti and Sr lines, and are considered a hot extension of the magnetic Ap/Bp stars. Others show overabundances of P and Ga, typically noted for HgMn stars. The star HD 139160 belongs to the non-magnetic subgroup of He-weak stars.    |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/719    |  Henry Draper catalog     |  A catalog of stars in which every star is classified by its stellar spectrum. This system is named for the astronomer Henry Draper, but was cataloged by Annie J. Cannon (225,300 stars), and later extended by Margaret W. Mayall.  |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/721    |  Henyey track     |  A nearly horizontal path on the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram that a pre-main sequence star of small mass follows in an early stage of evolution after leaving the Hayashi track and before reaching the main sequence. During this stage the pre-main sequence star remains almost wholly in radiative equilibrium.   |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/724    |  Hertzsprung gap  |  A region of the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, between the main sequence and the giant branch, occupied by very few stars. It corresponds to a very short period in stellar evolution.     |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/725    |  Hertzsprung Russell diagram  |  A display of stellar properties using a plot of effective temperature (or instead color or spectral type) along the abscissa versus luminosity (or absolute magnitude). The temperature is plotted in the inverse direction, with high temperatures on the left and low temperatures on the right. On the diagram the majority of stars are concentrated in a diagonal strip running from upper left to lower right, i.e. from high temperature-high luminosity massive stars to low temperature-low luminosity low-mass stars. This feature is known as the main sequence. This is the locus of stars burning hydrogen in their cores (proton-proton chain). The lower edge of this strip, known as the zero age main sequence (ZAMS), designates the positions where stars of different mass first begin to burn hydrogen in their cores. Well below the main sequence there is a group of stars that, despite being very hot, are so small that their luminosity is very small as a consequence. These are the class of white dwarfs. These objects represent old and very evolved stars that have shed their outer layers to reveal a very small but extremely hot inner core. They are no longer generating energy but are merely emitting light as they cool (white dwarf cooling track). Stars with high luminosities but relatively low temperatures occupy a wide region above the main sequence. The majority of them have used up all the hydrogen in their cores and have expanded and cooled as a result of internal readjustment. Called red giants, they are still burning helium in their cores (helium burning, carbon burning). There are also stars with very high luminosities, resulting from their enormous outputs of energy, because they are burning their fuel at a prodigious rate. These are the supergiants. They can be hot or cool, hence blue or red in color.   |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/730    |  Hierarchical cosmology   |  A cosmology characterized by clustering of galaxy clusters in increasingly larger systems.   |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/732    |  Massive stars    |  A star whose mass is larger than approximately 10 solar masses. The spectral types of massive stars range from about B3 (B star) to O2 (O star) and include Wolf-Rayet stars as well as Luminous Blue Variables. Massive stars are very rare; for each star of 20 solar masses there are some 100,000 stars of 1 solar mass. Despite this rarity, they play a key role in astrophysics. They are major sites of nucleosynthesis beyond oxygen and, therefore, are mainly responsible for the chemical evolution of galaxies. Due to their high ultraviolet flux and powerful stellar winds, they bring about interesting phenomena in the interstellar medium, like H II regions, turbulence, shocks, bubbles, and so on. Massive stars are progenitors of supernovae (type Ia, type Ic and type II), neutron stars, and black holes. The formation processes of massive stars is still an unresolved problem. For massive stars the accretion time scale is larger than the Kelvin-Helmholtz time scale. This means that massive stars reach the main sequence while accretion is still going on.   |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/733    |  High mass x-ray binary stars     |  A member of one of the two main classes of X-ray binary systems where one of the components is a neutron star or a black hole and the other one a massive star. HMXBs emit relatively hard X-rays and usually show regular pulsations, no X-ray bursts, and often X-ray eclipses. Their X-ray luminosity is much larger than their optical luminosity. In our Galaxy HMXBs are found predominantly in the spiral arms and within the Galactic disk in young stellar populations less than 10^7 years old. One of the most famous HMXB is Cygnus X-1 which was the first stellar-mass black hole discovered.  |

They have substantial neutral column densities (> 10^19 cm^-2) and their metallicities range from 0.1 to about 1.0 times solar. The distances to the majority of them remain unknown. They may represent the continuing infall of matter onto the Local Group.    |

|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/741    |  Hilda group  |  The asteroids found on the outer edge of the main asteroid belt in a 2:3 orbital resonance with Jupiter. The group is not an asteroid family since the members are not physically related. The group consists of asteroids with semi-major axes between 3.70 AU and 4.20 AU, eccentricities less than 0.30, and inclinations less than 20°. It is dominated by D- and P-type asteroids.  |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/746    |  Horizontal branch stars  |  A star lying on the horizontal branch.   |

|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/748    |  Horizontal parallax  |  The angle under which the radius of the Earth at the place of observation would be seen from a celestial body when it is in the horizon (at the instant of rising or setting). The amount varies with the latitude since the Earth is not exactly spherical, and is greatest at equator.     |

|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/753    |  Hot Jupiters     |  A giant, gaseous, Jupiter-like planet lying too close to its parent star and having an orbital period from a few days to a few weeks. The existence of hot Jupiters is usually interpreted in terms of planetary migration. These planets can, in principle, be formed at larger distances from their stars and migrate to the inner regions due to dynamical interaction with the proto-planetary disk.     |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/755    |  Hour angle   |  A telescope based coordinate specifying the angle, in the equatorial plane, from the meridian to a plane containing the celestial object and the north and south celestial poles.    |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/757    |  Hubble classification scheme     |  The classification of galaxies according to their visual appearance into four basic types suggested by E. Hubble: ellipticals (E), spirals (S), barred spirals (SB), and irregulars (Ir). Later on a separate class of lenticulars (S0) was appended as an intermediate type between ellipticals and spirals. The sequence starts with round elliptical galaxies (E0). Flatter galaxies are arranged following a number which is calculated from the ratio (a - b)/a, where a and b are the major and minor axes as measured on the sky. Ellipticals are divided into eight categories (E0, E1, ..., E7). Beyond E7 a clear disk is apparent in the lenticular (S0) galaxies. The sequence then splits into two parallel branches of disk galaxies showing spiral structure: ordinary spirals, S, and barred spirals, SB. The spiral and barred types are subdivided into Sa, Sb, Sc, and SBa, SBb, SBc, respectively. Along the sequence from Sa to Sc, the central bulge becomes smaller, while the spiral arms become more and more paramount. The original, erroneous idea that such arrangement of the galaxies might represent an evolutionary sequence led to the ellipticals being referred to as early-type galaxies, and the spirals and Irr I irregulars as late-type galaxies.   |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/758    |  Hubble constant  |  The Hubble parameter for the present epoch. It is the constant of proportionality between the recession velocities of galaxies and their distances from each other. The latest determinations using the Hubble Space Telescope observations of Cepheids give H_0 = 72 ± 8 km s^-1 Mpc^-1, the WMAP observations yield 70.4 ± 1.3 km s^-1 Mpc^-1, and the Planck Satellite observations give 67.3 ± 1.2 km s^-1 Mpc^-1. More recently, the Hubble constant was derived by a team of astronomers, using the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, with a 2.4% accuracy. The new value, 73.2 km s^-1 Mpc^-1, suggests that the Universe is expanding between five and nine percent faster than previously calculated. The Hubble law is only applicable for large distances (> 20 Mpc), when the proper motions of galaxies in groups and clusters cannot confuse the recession due to expansion.    |

|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/761    |  Hubble Space Telescope   |  A telescope of 2.4 m in diameter, a joint NASA and ESA project, launched in 1990 into a low-Earth orbit 600 km above the ground. It was equipped with a collection of several science instruments that worked across the entire optical spectrum (from infrared, through the visible, to ultraviolet light). During its lifetime Hubble has become one of the most important science projects ever.  |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/762    |  Hubble time  |  An estimate for the age of the Universe by presuming that the Universe has always expanded at the same rate as it is expanding today. It is the inverse of the Hubble-Lemaitre constant.     |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/763    |  Hubble-Lemaitre law  |  The speed with which a galaxy cluster recedes from us is directly proportional to its distance. It can be stated as v = H_{0}d, where v is the recessional velocity, H_0 the Hubble-Lemaitre constant, and d the distance.   |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/764    |  Humidity     |  Generally, a measure of the water vapor content of the air. Popularly, it is used synonymously with relative humidity.   |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/768    |  Hydrogen burning     |  A series of thermonuclear reactions, taking place mainly in low-mass stars, such as the Sun, which transforms four hydrogen nuclei (protons) into one helium (Helium-4) nucleus and thereby generates energy in the stellar core. First, two protons (Helium-1) combine to form a deuterium nucleus (Helium-2) with the emission of a positron and a neutrino.  The deuterium nucleus then rapidly captures another proton to form a Helium-3 nucleus, while emitting a gamma ray. There are three alternatives for the next step. In the proton-proton chain, occurring in 86% of the cases, two Helium-3 nuclei fuse to a final Helium-4 nucleus while two protons are released. The mass of the resulting Helium-4 nucleus is less than the total mass of the four original protons. The difference, ~ 0.7% of the total mass of the protons, is converted into energy and radiated by the Sun. In this process, the Sun loses some 4 million tons of its mass each second.   |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/770    |  Hydrosphere  |  A term denoting the water portion of the Earth's surface.    |

|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/772    |  Hydroxyl sources     |  An astronomical source emitting microwave radiation characteristic of the hydroxyl OH molecule, especially one showing a maser effect. OH sources are found in molecular clouds in interstellar medium and in the cool envelopes of evolved stars.   |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/773    |  Hyperbolic orbit     |  An orbit that is an open curve whose ends get wider apart at any rate between that of an ellipse and a straight line. Some comets' orbits become hyperbolic through the gravitational influence of a planet the comet passes near.   |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/774    |  Hypergiant stars     |  A high luminosity star with absolute visual magnitude around -10, about 10^6 times as luminous as the Sun. Hypergiant stars are evolved massive stars belonging to the luminosity class Ia+ or Ia0. Their spectra show very broadened emission and absorption lines resulting from the high luminosity and low surface gravity which favor strong stellar wind.  |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/775    |  Hypernovae   |  A highly energetic supernova explosion. This phenomenon, which is more violent than a typical supernova event, is accompanied by a gamma-ray burst.  |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/776    |  Hypervelocity stars  |  A star whose velocity is so great that it will escape the gravitational potential of our Galaxy. Depending on the location and direction of motion, this criterion typically corresponds to a stellar velocity in the Galactic rest frame larger than 400 km s^-1, and up to about 1200 km s^-1. The nature of the hypervelocity stars  (HVSs) spans a wide range of types from OB stars, to metal-poor F-type stars and G/K dwarfs. While there is evidence from many late-type B HVSs in the halo to originate from the Galactic supermassive black hole (SMBH), other HVSs seem to originate from the galactic disk. HVSs can obtain their large velocities from a number of different processes: 1) Tidal disruption of close binary stars by the central SMBH of the Milky Way. In this process one star is captured by the SMBH while the other is ejected at high speed via the gravitational slingshot mechanism. 2) Exchange encounters in other dense stellar environments between hard binaries and massive stars may cause stars to be ejected and escape our Galaxy. 3) Disruption of close binaries via supernova explosions. The runaway velocities of both ejected stars can reach large values when asymmetric supernovae are considered, i.e. when the newborn neutron star receives a momentum kick at birth.     |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/780    |  Inclination  |  An orbital element that defines the angle between the orbital plane of a solar system body (planet, comet, asteroid) and the plane of the ecliptic.  |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/784    |  Inflationary universe    |  A class of Big Bang models of the Universe that include a finite period of accelerated expansion in their early histories. Such an event would have released enormous energy, stored until then in the vacuum of space-time. The horizon of the Universe expanded, temporarily, much faster than the speed of light.     |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/786    |  Infrared astronomy   |  The study of infrared properties of astronomical objects.    |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/787    |  Infrared dark clouds     |  A dark cloud characterized by a visual extinction A_v ≥ 10^2 mag. Infrared dark clouds are opaque even at 8 μm, and can be seen in silhouette against the bright diffuse mid-infrared emission in the interstellar medium.   |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/788    |  Infrared excess  |  Infrared emission from a star in excess of that expected from a blackbody with the temperature corresponding to the temperature of the star.     |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/790    |  Infrared galaxies    |  A galaxy that emits most of its energy in the infrared region of the spectrum. Such galaxies are thought to have unusually high rates of star formation and are also described as starburst galaxies.    |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/794    |  Infrared telescopes  |  A telescope capable of observing infrared radiation from astronomical objects.   |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/797    |  Solar system terrestrial planets     |  The planets Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars collectively. They are also known as the terrestrial planets.     |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/798    |  Instability strip    |  A narrow, almost vertical, band on the right hand side of the main sequence in the H-R diagram occupied by many different types of pulsating stars (RR Lyrae, Cepheids, W Virginis, ZZ Ceti). Stars traverse this region at least once after they leave the main sequence. The narrow temperature range of the instability strip corresponds to the stellar effective temperature that can sustain partial ionization zones, capable of maintaining stellar oscillations. The blue (hot) edge of the instability strip pertains to stars with surface temperatures hotter than ~7500 K. Because these stars have partial ionization zones too close to their surface, the pulsation mechanism is not active. The red (cooler) edge of the instability strip is determined by stars with a temperature lower than ~5500 K. In these stars convection prevents the build-up of heat pressure necessary to drive pulsations.    |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/799    |  Astronomical instrumentation     |  The design and use of scientific instruments for detection, measurement, control, computation, and so on to observe and study astronomical objects.  |

|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/822    |  Interplanetary gas   |  Electrically charged particles of the solar wind and gas liberated from comets within the solar system.  |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/824    |  Interplanetary magnetic fields   |  The magnetic field that is carried along with the solar wind and fills the solar system space. It is wound into a spiral structure by the rotation of the Sun. At the Earth's distance from the Sun, it has a strength of about 5 x 10^-5 gauss.     |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/825    |  Interplanetary medium    |  The material contained in the solar system in the space through which the planets travel. It consists of the smaller objects such as asteroids, comets, meteorites and also a general pervading interplanetary dust. Moreover a plasma of charged particles streaming outward from the Sun in the form of the solar wind contributes to the interplanetary medium.   |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/831    |  Interstellar absorption  |  The absorption of light from stars and other objects by intervening gas and dust in interstellar space.  |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/834    |  Interstellar clouds  |  An aggregation of gas and dust in the interstellar medium containing large quantities of atoms, molecules, and dust. There are several types of interstellar clouds, such as diffuse interstellar clouds, dark clouds, molecular clouds.     |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/836    |  Interstellar dust    |  An aggregation of dust grains in the space between stars. Interstellar dust absorbs, scatters, and polarizes the light from distant stars, causing the interstellar extinction. Large dark regions in the plane of the Milky Way and other galaxies are caused by intervening clouds of dust. The conclusive proof for the presence of a general and selective interstellar absorption is due to R. J. Trumpler (1930).  |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/837    |  Interstellar dust extinction     |  The dimming of light traveling in the interstellar space due to the combined effects of absorption and scattering by interstellar dust particles. Interstellar extinction increases at shorter (bluer) wavelengths, resulting in interstellar reddening.     |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/841    |  Interstellar extinction  |  The dimming of light traveling in the interstellar space due to the combined effects of absorption and scattering by interstellar dust particles. Interstellar extinction increases at shorter (bluer) wavelengths, resulting in interstellar reddening.     |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/845    |  Interstellar magnetic fields     |  A large-scale, weak magnetic field, with an estimated strength of about 1 to 5 microgauss, that pervades the disk of the Milky Way Galaxy and controls the alignment of interstellar dust grains.    |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/846    |  Interstellar masers  |  A maser phenomenon created by young stars and protostars in the surrounding dense molecular clouds of gas and dust.  |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/847    |  Interstellar medium  |  The environment containing the interstellar matter (the gas and dust that exists in open space between the stars), consisting of gas (mostly hydrogen) and dust. Even at its densest phase, the interstellar medium is emptier than the best vacuum man can create in the laboratory, but because space is so vast, the interstellar medium still adds up to a huge amount of mass.  |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/849    |  Interstellar molecules   |  Any molecule that occurs naturally in clouds of gas and dust in the interstellar medium. So far more than 140 species have been discovered, many of which nonexistent on Earth.  |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/852    |  Interstellar radiation field     |  A global ionizing radiation in the interstellar medium provided by various sources all together.     |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/853    |  Interstellar reddening   |  The dimming of light during its travel in the interstellar medium due to absorption by intervening dust grains. Since shorter wavelengths are particularly affected, the spectrum of the light is increasingly dominated by the long wavelength end of the spectrum. As a result, the light is 'reddened' as it travels through space. Robert J. Trumpler (1886-1956), a Swiss-American astronomer, was the first to produce a definite evidence of the existence of interstellar extinction and to estimate its magnitude (1930).   |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/855    |  Interstellar scintillation   |  An apparent twinkling of the signals from distant point-like radio sources (pulsars). It is due to turbulence, i.e. fluctuations in the electron density of the interstellar ionized gas, through which the signals have passed on their way to Earth.   |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/858    |  Intracluster medium  |  A diffuse, hot, magnetized plasma that exists between galaxies in a galaxy cluster and is composed mainly of H, He, and heavy elements. The Intracluster medium (ICM) strongly emits X-rays, making it the most luminous extended X-ray source in Universe. While some of the gas has been stripped out of galaxies, it is also likely that some is also primordial in nature, and has been accreted into the clusters. The origin of the ICM is subject of intense investigation. Broadly, two possibilities have been envisaged. The first one considers the intracluster gas to be once contained in galaxies and later driven in the ICM. This would explain several observations: the presence of high metallicity gas, and H I deficiency of galaxies residing in the cores of rich clusters (which suggests that gas stripping has occurred). Alternatively, the ICM is primordial, originating at the time of cluster formation. Actually the ICM may result from a combination of both scenarios.   |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/859    |  Intrinsic variable stars     |  A variable star whose fluctuations in brightness are due to natural changes in the luminosity of the star itself, not by external causes, such as in extrinsic variable stars.   |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/860    |  Earth ionosphere     |  The region of the Earth's upper atmosphere containing a small percentage of free electrons and ions produced by photoionization of the constituents of the atmosphere by solar ultraviolet radiation.    |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/863    |  Iron meteorites  |  A meteorite which is composed mainly of iron mixed with smaller amounts of nickel. Iron meteorites make up about 4.4% of all meteorites.     |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/864    |  Irregular galaxies   |  A galaxy with no spiral structure and no symmetric shape. Irregular galaxies are usually filamentary or very clumpy in shape and tend to smaller than others. Two types of irregular galaxies are defined, Irr I galaxy and Irr II galaxy.   |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/865    |  Irregular variable stars     |  A type of variable star in which variations in brightness show no regular periodicity. There are two main types, irregular eruptive variables and irregular pulsating variables.     |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/869    |  Jeans mass   |  The minimum mass for an interstellar cloud below which the thermal pressure of the gas prevents its collapse under the force of its own gravity.  High density favors collapse, while high temperature favors larger Jeans mass.     |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/870    |  Jets     |  Fountain-like formations of gas and/or dust gushing out from compact regions of some astronomical objects.   |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/873    |  Jupiter  |  The largest planet in the Solar System and the fifth from the Sun, lying at a mean distance of about 5.2 astronomical units from the Sun. Jupiter is a gas giant, mostly hydrogen and helium, with a mass of 1.898 x 10^27 kg, or about 0.001 solar masses, or 318 times Earth masses. It is more than twice as massive as all the other solar system planets combined. Jupiter's diameter measures 11 times that of Earth. Its rotation period, 9.93 hours (Jupiter/Earth ratio = 0.41), is the shortest of all the solar system planets. Its orbital period is 11.857 Earth years. Jupiter has an extensive family of satellites (79 known) and a faint ring system; Jupiter's ring. Jupiter probably has a core of rocky material amounting to something like 10 to 15 Earth masses. Above the core lies the main bulk of the planet in the form of liquid metallic hydrogen. This exotic form of the most common of elements is possible only at pressures about 3 million bars, as is the case in the interior of Jupiter (and Saturn). Under the extreme pressure found deep inside Jupiter, the electrons are released from the hydrogen molecules and are free to move about the interior. This causes hydrogen to behave as a metal; it becomes conducting for both heat and electricity.   |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/874    |  Jupiter trojans  |  The family of asteroids that share Jupiter's orbit and lie in elongated, curved regions around the two Lagrangian points 60° ahead and behind of Jupiter. The Lagrangian points L4 and L5 host several thousands of them.    |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/878    |  K stars  |  An orange-red star of spectral type K with a surface temperature of about 3600-5000 K. The spectra of K stars are dominated by the H and K lines of calcium and lines of neutral iron and titanium, with molecular bands due to cyanogen (CN) and titanium dioxide (TiO). Examples are Arcturus and Aldebaran.   |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/882    |  Kappa mechanism  |  A process based on the effects of opacity (κ) that drives the pulsations of many types of variable stars. Consider a layer of material within a star and suppose that it undergoes inward contraction. This inward motion tends to compress the layer and increase the density. Therefore the layer becomes more opaque. If a certain amount of flux comes from the deeper layers it gets stuck in the high κ region. The energy accumulates and heat builds up beneath it. The pressure rises below the layer, pushing it outward. The layer expands as it moves outward, cools and becomes more transparent to radiation. Energy can now escape from below the layer, and pressure beneath the layer diminishes. The layer falls inward and the cycle repeats. The κ mechanism is believed to account for the pulsations of several star families, including Delta Scuti stars, Beta Cephei variables, Cepheids, and RR Lyrae stars.   |

|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/889    |  Kirkwood gaps    |  Regions in the asteroid belt within which few asteroids are found. The Kirkwood gaps are due to the perturbing effects of Jupiter through resonances with Jupiter's orbital period.  |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/892    |  Kruskal diagram  |  A diagram used to plot trajectories in space-time near a black hole. The vertical and horizontal axes are two complicated functions of time and distance from the black hole. Lines of constant time radiate from the origin of the diagram, with steeper slopes corresponding to later times. Lines of constant distance are hyperbolas, lines of constant time pass through the origin; photons always travel along diagonal lines at ±45° to the vertical. The trajectory of an object falling into the black hole is shown as a curving line moving upward on the diagram at less than 45° to the vertical.  |

L dwarfs are intermediate in temperature between M and T dwarfs. Their spectra in the optical show weak titanium oxide (TiO) and vanadium oxide (VO) absorption lines and strong metallic hydrides CrH (8611 and 9969 Å) and FeH (8692 and 9896 Å). Also are present strong neutral atomic lines of alkali metals Na I (8183, 8195 Å), K I (7665, 7699 Å), Rb I (7800, 7948 Å), Cs I (8521, 8943 Å), and sometimes Li I (6708 Å).

|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/897    |  Lagrangian points    |  Five locations in space where the centrifugal force and the gravitational force of two bodies (m orbiting M) neutralize each other. A third, less massive body, located at any one of these points, will be held in equilibrium with respect to the other two. Three of the points, L1, L2, and L3, lie on a line joining the centers of M and m. L1 lies between M and m, near to m, L2 lies beyond m, and L3 on the other side of M beyond the orbit. The other two points, L4 and L5, which are the most stable, lie on either side of this line, in the orbit of m around M, each of them making an equilateral triangle with M and m. L4 lies in the m's orbit approximately 60° ahead of it, while L5 lies in the m's orbit approximately 60° behind m.    |

The LMC shines with a total apparent visual magnitude of approximately zero. It spans an area of the sky about 9 by 11 degrees, corresponding to about 30,000 light-years across in the longest dimension, for a distance of some 162,000 light-years. It has a visible mass of about one-tenth that of our own Galaxy (10^10 M_sun). The LMC and its twin, the Small Magellanic Cloud, are two of our most prominent Galactic neighbors. The LMC is classified as a disrupted barred spiral galaxy of type SBm, the prototype of a class of Magellanic spirals. The galaxy is characterized by a prominent offset stellar bar located near its center with the dominant spiral arm to the north with two "embryonic" arms situated to the south. The metallicity in the LMC is known to be lower than in the solar neighborhood by a factor 2 or more. Based on 20 eclipsing binary systems, the distance to the LMC is measured to one percent precision to be 49.59±0.09 (statistical) ±0.54 (systematic) kpc.     |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/907    |  Late-type galaxies   |  In the Hubble classification, a galaxy on the left part of the Hubble sequence.  |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/909    |  Late-type stars  |  A star of spectral type K, M, S, or C, with a surface temperature lower than that of the Sun.    |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/917    |  Libration    |  Small oscillations of a celestial body about its mean position. The term is used mainly to mean the Moon's libration caused by the apparent wobble of the Moon as it orbits the Earth. The Moon always keeps the same side toward the Earth, but due to libration, 59% of the Moon's surface can be seen over a period of time. This results from three kinds of libration working in combination: libration in longitude, libration in latitude, and diurnal libration.     |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/918    |  Light curves     |  A curve showing the behavior of the light from a variable star over a period of time.    |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/919    |  Light year   |  The distance that light travels in one year at about 300,000 km per second, i.e. 9.5 x 10^12 km. It is equal to about 63,000 astronomical units.     |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/920    |  LIGO     |  A facility dedicated to the detection and measurement of cosmic gravitational waves. It consists of two widely separated installations, or detectors, within the United States, operated in unison as a single observatory. One installation is located in Hanford (Washington) and the other in Livingston (Louisiana), 3,000 km apart. Funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF), LIGO was designed and constructed by a team of scientists from the California Institute of Technology, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and by industrial contractors. Construction of the facilities was completed in 1999. Initial operation of the detectors began in 2001. Each LIGO detector beams laser light down arms 4 km long, which are arranged in the shape of an 'L.' If a gravitational wave passes through the detector system, the distance traveled by the laser beam changes by a minuscule amount -- less than one-thousandth of the size of an atomic nucleus (10^-18 m). Still, LIGO should be able to pick this difference up. LIGO directly detected gravitational waves for the first time from a binary black hole merger (GW150914) on September 14, 2015. The Nobel Prize in physics 2017 was awarded to three physicists (Rainer Weiss, Barry C. Barish, and Kip S. Thorne) for decisive contributions to the LIGO detector and the observation of gravitational waves. LIGO had a prominent role in the detection of GW170817, the first event with an electromagnetic counterpart.    |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/921    |  Limb brightening     |  An observed increase in the intensity of radio, extreme ultraviolet, or X-radiation from the Sun from its center to its limb.    |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/922    |  Limb darkening   |  An apparent decrease in brightness of the Sun near its edge as compared to its brightness toward the center. Limb darkening is readily apparent in photographs of the Sun. The reason is that when we look toward the disk's center we look into deeper and hence hotter layers along the line of sight. Toward the limb, we get radiation from higher and hence cooler and less bright layers of the photosphere. Limb darkening has been detected in the case of several other stars. A similar phenomenon occurs in eclipsing binaries where the effect of limb darkening on one or both components manifests itself in the shape of the system's light curve.    |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/923    |  Limiting magnitude   |  The faintest magnitude reachable by an instrument.   |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/924    |  Line of sight    |  The imaginary straight line connecting the object and the objective lens of the viewing device.  |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/928    |  Lithosphere  |  The solid portion of the Earth, as compared to the atmosphere and the hydrosphere. The lithosphere consists of semi-rigid plates that move relative to each other on the underlying asthenosphere. The process is known as plate tectonics and helps explain continental drift.  |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/929    |  Local Group  |  A small galaxy cluster of about 50 galaxies to which our Milky Way galaxy belongs. The Local Group occupies a volume of space nearly 10 million light-years across centered somewhere between the Andromeda Galaxy (M31) and the Milky Way, which are the dominant galaxies of the group; Andromeda being the principal member. Both of these galaxies exhibit spiral structures, and each is attended by a large family of satellite dwarf galaxies. The Local Group also includes a third spiral galaxy known as Triangulum (M33), which is bound to Andromeda. The remaining members span a range of Hubble classification types from dwarf spheroidal to Irr to Sb and Sc and cover a factor of 10 in metallicity. The total mass of the Local Group is estimated to be about 2 x 10^12 solar masses, although this value is still uncertain to within a factor of about 2. The velocities of the individual galaxies of the Local Group are not particularly high. Therefore no member is believed to be able to escape the group, which is thus considered to be gravitationally bound. Another remarkable member of the Group is IC 10.   |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/933    |  Long period comets   |  A comet with orbital period of more than 200 years.  |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/935    |  Long period variable stars   |  A type of variable star in which variations in brightness occur over long time-scales of months or years. The term generally refers to Mira variable types.  |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/936    |  Longitude of the ascending node  |  One of the orbital elements used to specify the orbit of an object in space. It is the angle from the reference direction, called the origin of longitude, to the direction of the ascending node, measured in the reference plane.  |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/939    |  Low-mass x-ray binary stars  |  A member of one of the two main classes of X-ray binary systems where one of the components is a neutron star or black hole and the other component a low-mass star with a spectral type A or later. LMXBs mainly emit soft X-rays. The ratio of their optical to X-ray luminosities is less than 0.1. They belong to old stellar populations with ages 5-15 x 10^9 years and are found in globular clusters and in the bulge of our Milky Way galaxy; some are also found in the disk. Hercules X-1 is an example of LMXBs.     |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/940    |  Low surface brightness galaxies  |  A member of a particularly faint population of galaxies with a central surface brightness below the brightness of the background sky. The central regions of many of them resemble a dwarf galaxy, but most of the mass is contained in a large gaseous disk of low density that is observable only with long-exposure optical images or at radio wavelengths. Some are as massive as a large spiral galaxy, for example Malin 1. The proportion of LSBGs relative to normal galaxies is unknown. They may however represent a significant fraction of mass in the Universe. LSBGs are thought to be primitive systems because they have total masses similar to normal galaxies, but have typically converted less than 10% of their gas into stars. Spiral LSBGs do not obey Freeman's law.    |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/941    |  Luminosity classification    |  A classification of stellar spectra according to luminosity for a given spectral type. The luminosity class is an indication of a star's surface gravity. It is shown by a Roman numeral as follows: I (supergiants), II (bright giants), III (normal giants), IV (subgiants), and V (dwarf stars, or main-sequence stars). Luminosity classes VI (subdwarfs) and VII (white dwarfs) are rarely used. Subclasses a, b, and c are especially used for supergiants, while the most luminous hypergiants are assigned luminosity class Ia-0.    |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/942    |  Luminosity function  |  Number distribution of stars or galaxies (galaxy) with respect to their absolute magnitudes. The luminosity function shows the number of stars of a given intrinsic luminosity (or the number of galaxies per integrated magnitude band) in a given volume of space.     |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/944    |  Luminous blue variable stars     |  A high-luminosity variable star, which represents a transition phase in the life of a massive star when it evolves off the main sequence to become a supernova. Only about a dozen confirmed luminous blue variable stars are presently known in our Galaxy.     |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/946    |  Luminous infrared galaxies   |  A galaxy that emits most of its energy in the infrared and whose infrared luminosity (in the 8-1000 µm range) is more than 10^11 solar luminosities.     |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/949    |  Lunar craters    |  A bowl-like depression on the rigid surface of the Moon, usually caused by the high-speed impact of a colliding object.  |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/950    |  Lunar domes  |  Rounded volcanic structure on the Moon produced by eruption or intrusion of viscous high-silica magma. An uplift that is round or elliptical in map view of the Moon with beds dipping away in all directions from a central point.  |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/951    |  Lunar eclipses   |  The darkening of the Moon which occurs when the Moon enters the umbra of the Earth's shadow. This phenomenon can occur only when the full Moon is near one of the lunar nodes of its orbit around the Earth. There will be a total eclipse if the entire Moon enters the umbra, otherwise the eclipse will be partial when the Moon is somewhat to the north or south of the node and does not cross the shadow entirely. During the eclipse the Moon looks more or less dark, depending especially on the transparency of the Earth's atmosphere. The refraction of Sun's light through the atmosphere sometimes gives a red color to the eclipsed Moon. Colored fringes can be seen around the shadow edge during partial eclipses. Because an eclipse of the Moon is due to the cutting off of the Sun's light, it is visible from the entire hemisphere where the Moon is above the horizon. The maximum duration of a total lunar eclipse, when the Moon passes through the shadow centrally, is 1h 47m.    |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/957    |  Lunar highlands  |  A light color area on the Moon, as contrasted with lunar maria.  |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/961    |  Lunar maria  |  Areas on the surface of the Moon that appears darker and smoother than their surroundings. Once thought to be seas, lunar maria are now known to be basaltic basins created by volcanic lava floods.     |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/968    |  Lunar phase  |  One of the various changes in the apparent shape of the Moon, because as the Moon orbits the Earth different amounts of its illuminated part are facing us. The phases of the Moon include: the new moon, waxing crescent, first quarter, waxing gibbous, full moon, waning gibbous, last quarter, waning crescent, and new moon again.  |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/969    |  Lunar probes     |  A probe for exploring and reporting on conditions on or about the Moon.  |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/971    |  Lunar rilles     |  A long, narrow, straight or sinuous trench or valley with steep walls and roughly parallel sides on the surface of the Moon.     |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/976    |  Lunar transient phenomena    |  A short-lived change in the brightness of patches on the face of the Moon. The TLPs last from a few seconds to a few hours and can grow from less than a few to a hundred kilometers in size. They have been reported by many observers since the invention of the telescope. However, the physical mechanism responsible for creating a TLP is not well understood. Several theories have been proposed, among which lunar outgassing, that is, gas being released from the surface of the Moon.    |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/980    |  Lyman alpha forest   |  The appearance of many differentially redshifted Lyman alpha lines in absorption in a quasar's spectrum, caused by intervening hydrogen clouds along our line of sight to the quasar.    |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/982    |  M dwarf stars    |  A star whose spectrum is dominated by the absorption bands of titanium oxide (TiO) and vanadium oxide (VO) and has many neutral metal lines. The effective temperature of M dwarfs ranges from about 3850 to 2600 K. They are low mass stars with masses ranging from 0.6 times that of the Sun at spectral type M0 to less than 0.1 solar masses. M dwarfs are very abundant, they account for about 70-80% of stars in the Galactic disk. The nearest star to the Sun, Proxima Centauri, is an M dwarf.    |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/985    |  M stars  |  A cool, red star of spectral type M with a surface temperatures of less than 3600 K. The spectra of M stars are dominated by molecular bands, especially those of TiO. Naked-eye examples are Betelgeuse and Antares.    |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/990    |  Magellanic Clouds    |  Two irregular satellite galaxies of our own Galaxy which are visible from the Southern Hemisphere as misty patches in the night sky.     |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/991    |  Magellanic Stream    |  A thin trail of gas stretching from the Magellanic System toward our own Galaxy over about 150° on the sky, corresponding to hundreds of thousands of light-years. This gas consists primarily of neutral hydrogen and is thought to have originated from the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds as a result of tidal interactions with the Milky Way.    |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/992    |  Magnetars    |  A highly magnetized neutron star with fields a thousand times stronger than those of radio pulsars. There are two sub-classes of magnetars, anomalous X-Ray pulsar (AXP)s and soft gamma repeater (SGR)s, that were thought for many years to be separate and unrelated objects. In fact SGRs and AXPs are both neutron stars possessing magnetic fields of unprecedented strength of 10^14 - 10^16 G, and that show both steady X-ray pulsations as well as soft gamma-ray bursts. Their inferred steady X-ray luminosities are about one hundred times higher than their spin-down luminosities, requiring a source of power well beyond the magnetic dipole spin-down that powers rotation-powered pulsar (RPP)s. New high-energy components discovered in the spectra of a number of AXPs and SGRs require non-thermal particle acceleration and look very similar to high-energy spectral components of young rotation-powered pulsars.     |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/994    |  Magnetic fields  |  A field of force that is generated by electric currents, or, equivalently, a region in which magnetic forces can be observed.    |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/995    |  Magnetic stars   |  A star whose spectral lines show the Zeeman effect.  |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/999    |  Magnitude    |  A measure of brightness in astronomy on a logarithmic scale in which a difference of five magnitudes represents a difference of 100 times in brightness. In this scale the lower a magnitude, the brighter the object. The faintest magnitude reached by unaided eye is 6.   |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1001   |  Major axis   |  The greatest diameter of an ellipse; it passes through the two foci.     |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1005   |  Mantle   |  A major subdivision of a planet's internal structure, located beneath the planet's crust and above the central core.     |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1007   |  Mars     |  Fourth planet from Sun and the seventh largest. Mass 6.42 x 10^26 g (0.11 Earth's); radius 3397 km. Mean distance from Sun 1.52 AU. Sidereal period 687 days; synodic period 779.9 days. Surface temperature 248 K., rotational period 24h 37m 22.66s. Obliquity 23°59'. Atmosphere more than 90% CO_2, traces of O_2, CO, H_{2}O. Two tiny satellites (Phobos and Deimos), both of which are locked in synchronous rotation with Mars.  |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1008   |  Mars trojans     |  The family of asteroids located at either of the stable Lagrangian points (L4 or L5) of the orbit of Mars.   |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1010   |  Mascon   |  A region on the surface of the Moon where the gravitational attraction is slightly higher than normal due to the presence of dense rock.     |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1015   |  Maunder minimum  |  A period from about 1645 to 1715 when the number of sunspots was unusually low. This solar activity minimum is attested also through the increased content of carbon-14 in tree rings in that period. The reason is that the cosmic rays which produce carbon-14 reach the Earth in a greater number when there is weak solar activity. The Maunder minimum occurred during a period of cooling of the Earth, called the Little Ice Age. The Maunder minimum is one of a number of periods of low solar activity, including the Dalton minimum, the Sporer minimum, the Wolf minimum, and the Oort minimum.  |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1019   |  Mean anomaly     |  The angle between the periapsis of an orbit and the position of a hypothetical body that orbits in the same period as the real one but at a constant mean angular velocity.  |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1024   |  Mercury (planet)     |  The closest planet to the Sun and one of five planets visible with the naked eye. The greatest elongation of Mercury is about 28°, making it visible at most about 112 minutes after sunset or before sunrise. It lies at a mean distance of about 0.39 astronomical units from the Sun. Mercury is just 4,879 km in diameter, about 2.6 times smaller than the Earth. Its orbital period is 87.97 Earth days. Mercury has a high density, 5.4 g cm^-3, with only the Earth having a higher density among the planets. This is largely due to Mercury being composed mainly of heavy metals and rock. One solar day on Mercury lasts the equivalent of 176 Earth days while the sidereal day (the time for 1 rotation in relation to a fixed point) lasts 59 Earth days. Mercury is nearly tidally locked to the Sun and over time this has slowed the rotation of the planet to almost match its orbit around the Sun. Mercury also has the highest orbital eccentricity of all the planets with its distance from the Sun ranging from 46 to 70 million km. Mercury has just 38% the gravity of Earth, this is too little to maintain an atmosphere against solar winds, which blow it away. The surface of Mercury which faces the Sun has temperatures of up to 427°C, whilst on the alternate side this can be as low as -173°C. Mercury's core has more iron than any other planet in the solar system. This has to do with its formation and early life. If the planet formed quickly, increasing temperatures of the evolving Sun could have vaporized much of the existing surface, leaving only a thin shell.  |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1025   |  Mercury-manganese stars  |  Chemically peculiar stars of late B-types. The most distinctive features of Mercury-manganese stars are extreme atmospheric overabundance of Hg (up to 5 dex) and of Mn (up to 3 dex). The origin of abundance anomalies observed in late B-type stars with HgMn peculiarity is still poorly understood. More than two thirds of the HgMn stars are known to belong to spectroscopic binaries with a preference of orbital periods ranging from 3 to 20 days.    |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1026   |  Meridian     |  An imaginary great circle on the celestial sphere that passes through its poles and the observer's zenith.   |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1027   |  Meridian circles     |  A telescope with a graduated vertical scale, used to measure the declinations of heavenly bodies and sometimes to determine the time of meridian transits.   |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1030   |  Mesosphere   |  The layer of the atmosphere located between the stratosphere and the ionosphere, where temperature drops rapidly with increasing height. It extends between 17 to 80 kilometers above the Earth's surface.   |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1031   |  Metallicity  |  In a star, nebula, or galaxy, the proportion of the material that is made up of metals, that is elements heavier than helium. It is generally denoted by Z. The term 'metallicity' is a misnomer used in astrophysics.  In practice, the metallicity of stars is usually expressed by the number ratio of iron atoms to hydrogen atoms per unit volume, with respect to the solar values: [Fe/H] = log10(NFe/NH)star - log10(NFe/NH)Sun, where NFe and NH are the numbers of iron and hydrogen atoms per unit volume. In fact it is taken to be equal to the iron abundance with respect to the solar value. The solar logarithmic iron abundance is 7.50 ± 0.04, with respect to that of hydrogen which, by convention, is 12.00. Stellar metallicity is often expressed in mass fraction.  Nebular metallicity is often defined as the relative abundance of oxygen: (NO/NH)neb/(NO/NH)Sun, where N_O and N_H represent the numbers of oxygen and hydrogen atoms per unit volume.  |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1034   |  Meteor showers   |  An increased number of meteors all appearing to diverge from the direction of a single point, called radiant. Meteor showers occur annually on the same dates, when the Earth crosses through a meteoroid stream. Meteor showers are named after the constellation in which the radiant is located. For example, the Perseids's radiant lies near the top of the constellation Perseus. Most meteor showers are caused by comets. As a comet orbits the Sun it sheds an icy, dusty debris stream along its orbit. When the Earth's orbit intersects the dust trail, more meteors are seen as the cometary debris encounters our planet's atmosphere. In the case of the Geminids and Quadrantids, those meteor showers come from the debris scattered by orbiting asteroids. Typical meteor showers show 15 to 100 meteors per hour at their peak. On very rare occasions, during a meteor storm, thousands of meteors fall per hour. Prominent meteor showers are: Quadrantids, Lyrids, Eta Aquariids, Delta Aquariids, Perseids, Orionids, Taurids, Leonids, Geminids, Ursids, Alpha Capricornids.     |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1035   |  Meteor streams   |  The meteoroids distributed all along an orbit and diffused somewhat around it.   |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1038   |  Meteorites   |  An object of extraterrestrial origin that survives entry through the atmosphere to reach the Earth's surface. Meteors become meteorites if they reach the ground.    |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1040   |  Meteoroids   |  A solid object in interplanetary space before it reaches the Earth's atmosphere. Meteoroids are of silicate and/or metallic matter having a size from tiniest grains up to that of the smallest asteroids.   |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1041   |  Meteors  |  A streak of light caused when a meteoroid enters Earth's atmosphere and becomes incandescent, mostly from friction with the air at high speed. Meteors are also referred to as shooting stars. Very bright meteors are called fireball or bolide. Most of visible meteors arise from particles ranging in size from about that of a small pebble down to a grain of sand, and generally weigh less than 1-2 grams. The brilliant flash of light from a meteor is mainly caused by the meteoroid's high level of kinetic energy as it collides with the atmosphere at high speeds (11-72 km/s). The increase in the number of meteors visible toward the end of the night results from the fact that the Earth rotates about its axis in the same direction as it orbits the Sun. This means that the leading edge (morning side) of the Earth encounters more meteoroids than the trailing edge (evening side). In general, 2 to 3 times as many meteors can be seen in the hour or so just before morning twilight, than can be seen in the early evening. Moreover, the numbers of random, or sporadic, meteors vary from season to season, due to the tilt of the Earth on its axis and other factors.    |

|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1047   |  Micrometeorites  |  A small grain sized meteorite which can only be positively identified under the microscope.  |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1054   |  Milky Way Galaxy     |  A spiral galaxy, of which the solar system is a small part. It is the second largest in our Local Group of galaxies. The Milky Way is a disk-shaped system, with a diameter of between 80,000 and 100,000 light-years and a thickness of about 2,000 light-years, containing more than 10^11 stars. The stars are divided into two main categories, Population II stars and Population I stars. The core, or nucleus, of the Galaxy is surrounded by an ellipsoidal central bulge that measures some 15,000 light-years in diameter and about 6,000 light-years in the direction perpendicular to the plane of the disk. Surrounding the bulge and extending in a near spherical distribution above and below the Galactic plane is the Galactic halo. The halo contains about 200 globular clusters and an extremely thinly scattered population of individual stars. The Sun is located just over half way out from the center to the edge of the disk at a distance of about 25,000 light-years. In common with other stars, the Sun revolves around the Galactic Center. Its orbital velocity is about 220 km s^-1 and its orbital period is about 225 million years. Overall, the Galaxy exhibits differential rotation, that is stars and gas clouds closer to the center have shorter orbital periods than those that are located further out. The spiral arms of the Milky Way lie within its disk, where bright young stars, H II regions, and molecular clouds of gas and dust are concentrated into curved 'arms' that appear to radiate from the central bulge in a spiral pattern. The Galaxy's spiral pattern consists of several major arms and a number of shorter segments, one of which, the Orion arm, contains the Sun and the Orion star-forming region. Near-infrared observations have shown that the stars in the central bulge are arranged in an elongated galactic bar, about twice as long as it is wide, that is seen nearly end on from the present location of the solar system. The exact center, or nucleus, of the Galaxy coincides with a strong source of radio emission, called Sagittarius A, that is less than 15 astronomical units in diameter. Observations of the speeds at which clouds of ionized gas are revolving round the Galactic center imply that several million solar masses of material are concentrated within a region of about one light-year in radius. Since only about half of this mass can be accounted for by stars, it seems likely that the balance (about 2.5 million solar masses) is contained in a central black hole and that accretion onto this black hole is the underlying source of the energy radiated by Sagittarius A. The Milky Way also has a dark matter component. The Galactic rotation curve indicates that there is a large amount of invisible non-baryonic surrounding the whole Galaxy.     |

|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1068   |  Missing mass     |  The unseen mass whose gravitational influence is needed to account for the way galaxies rotate, and also to bind clusters of galaxies together. It is thought to consist, in part, of giant halos of dark matter that surround the visible portions of galaxies, and similar material that invisibly occupies the intergalactic voids.   |

The equatorial radius of Neptune is 24,764 km (3.883 Earths), its semi-major axis is 30.11 astronomical units (4.50 x 10^9 km), and its orbital period is 164.8 yr. Neptune has at least 14 moons, the largest ones are Triton, Proteus, and Nereid, whereas its smaller moons are: Naiad, Thalassa, Despina, Galatea, Larissa, Halimede, Sao, Laomedeia, Psamathe, and Neso. Neptune has an incredibly thick atmosphere comprised of 74% hydrogen, 25% helium, and approximately 1% methane. Particles of icy methane in its upper atmosphere give Neptune its deep blue color. Large storms whirl through Neptune's upper atmosphere, and high-speed winds track around the planet at up 600 m/s, fastest recorded in the solar system. One of the largest storms ever seen was recorded in 1989. Called the Great Dark Spot, it lasted about five years. Neptune has a very thin collection of rings. They are likely made up of ice particles mixed with dust grains and possibly coated with a carbon-based substance.   |

The hottest O-type stars display high ionization emission features such as N III and He II, Of star. They are divided into subtypes O2, the hottest, to O9.7, the coldest. O-type stars are relatively rare, for each star of 100 solar masses there are 10^6 stars of solar mass. They are relatively short-lived since they spend only a few million years on the main sequence.

Also, the period of time for which this blocking takes place. A solar eclipse is a particular case of occultation. Determining the moment of stellar occultation by the Moon is used to improve our knowledge of the lunar orbit. Moreover, the occultation of stars by asteroids or planetary satellites provide important data for better measuring the sizes of the occulting bodies.  |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1151   |  Ocean planets    |  A hypothetical exoplanet covered by a water envelope. The presence of such a planet stems from the implicit assumption of Habitable Zone temperatures and a liquid water surface.    |

The N III lines are always much stronger than C III 4647-4650-4651 when the latter are present. Historically, Of stars were considered to belong to the peculiar category, hence the f notation (see below). In his thesis work, Walborn removed them from that category and established them as the normal O-type supergiants. He also used the notation ((f)), (f), and f to describe the progression from strong He II 4686 absorption, through weakened/absent, to emission, respectively, correlated with increasing N III emission strength, subsequently showing that it is a luminosity sequence -- the first such for stars earlier than O9.     |

At opposition the body has a solar elongation of 180°, and is closest to the Earth. It will, in principle, be visible throughout the night. It will rise in the east as the Sun sets in the west and it will set as the Sun rises. This is because, at opposition, the body and the Sun are 12 hours apart. The inner planets can never be in opposition. The opposite of opposition is conjunction.    |

|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1234   |  Photometry   |  In astronomy, the measurement of the light of astronomical objects, generally in the visible or infrared bands, in which a wavelength band is normally specified.    |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1236   |  Photon sphere    |  A surface where if a photon is emitted from one of its points the photon follows a closed orbit and returns periodically to its departure point. Such a surface exists only near sufficiently compact objects where the curvature of space-time is very important. In other words, a body can take a stable orbit around a black hole provided that it moves with the speed of light. However, only photons can have such a velocity; hence the term 'photon sphere.' For a non-rotating Schwarzschild black hole, the photon sphere has a radius of R = 3GM/c2 = 3 RS/2, where G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass, c is the speed of light, and RS is the Schwarzschild radius. For a rotating, Kerr black hole, the situation is much more complex due to the Lense-Thirring effect. In that case circular paths exist for radii whose values depend on the rotation direction. More specifically, in the equatorial plane there are two possible circular light paths: a smaller one in the direction of the rotation, and a larger one in the opposite direction.    |

|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1267   |  Pluto    |  A dwarf planet in the solar system which until 2006 was known as the 9th major planet. Pluto revolves around the Sun in a highly elliptical orbit at a mean distance of 39.5 astronomical units once every about 248 years. The orbit eccentricity is 0.25 (compare with the Earth's 0.02) yielding a perihelion distance of 29.66 astronomical units and an aphelion distance of 48.87 AU. Its orbital inclination is 17 degrees, which is much higher than those of the other planets. Pluto's mass is 1.308 x 10^22 kg, that is 0.00218 Earth mass (0.177 Moon mass), its equatorial radius is 0.19 Earth radius, and its rotation period is equal to 6.39 Earth days. It has five known satellites, in order of distance from Pluto: Charon, Styx, Nix, Kerberos, and Hydra. Pluto's radius is estimated to be about 1150 km (0.18 Earths). Pluto is smaller than seven of the solar system's satellites (the Moon, Io, Europa, Ganymede, Callisto, Titan, and Triton). Pluto's surface has an estimated temperature of 37.5 K and is composed of more than 98% nitrogen  ice, with traces of methane and carbon monoxide.   |

|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1285   |  Population III stars     |  A member of the first generation of stars, formed out of pristine gas, enriched by primordial nucleosynthesis alone. The material from which these stars formed consisted mostly of hydrogen and helium. Because neutral hydrogen clouds were free of dust, their cooling mechanism was drastically ineffective. As a result, these star forming clouds had a much higher temperature than in the present epoch, and their Jeans mass was much higher. Therefore, these first generation of stars were principally massive, with a typical mass scale of order of about 100 M_sun. Population III stars started forming about 300 million years after the Big Bang at redshifts between 50 and 6, when the Universe had between 1 and 5% of its present age. These stars were probably responsible for the reionization of the Universe. Given their high mass, they lived only a few million years ending with either a pair-instability supernova phase or a direct collapse to a black hole. Population III stars thus initiated the chemical enrichment of the Universe and opened the way to more normal modes of star formation, namely Population II. Some models predict a bimodal initial mass function for the first stars, allowing also for solar mass stars.    |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1286   |  Position angle   |  The convention for measuring angles on the sky in astronomy (abbreviated as PA). It is the direction of an imaginary arrow in the sky, measured from north through east: 0° = north, 90° = east, 180° = south, and so on to 359° and back to 0°.

|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1299   |  Proton-proton reaction   |  A thermonuclear reaction in which two protons collide at very high velocities and combine to form a deuterium.   |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1300   |  Protoplanetary disks     |  A circumstellar disk of gas and dust surrounding a pre-main sequence star from which planetary systems form. Protoplanetary disks are remnants of accretion disks which bring forth stars. Typically, their sizes are ~100-500 AU, masses ~10^-2 solar masses, lifetimes ~10^6 - 10^7 years, and accretion rates ~10^-7 - 10^-8 solar masses per year. According to the standard theory of planet formation, called core accretion, planets come into being by the growth of dust grains which stick together and produce ever larger bodies, known as planetesimals. The agglomeration of these planetesimals of 100 to 1000 km in size into rocky Earth-mass planets is the main outcome of this theory. Beyond the snow line in the disk, if the masses of these cores of rock and ice grow higher than 10 times that of Earth in less than a few million years, gas can rapidly accrete and give rise to giant gaseous planets similar to Jupiter. If core building goes on too slowly, the disk gas dissipates before the formation of giant planets can start. Finally the left-over planetesimals that could not agglomerate into rocky planets or core of giant planets remain as a debris disk around the central object that has become a main sequence star. An alternative to core accretion theory is formation of planets in a massive protoplanetary disk by gravitational instabilities. The validity of these two theories is presently debated.    |

|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1302   |  Protostars   |  A stage in the process of star formation, after the gravitational collapse of the dense pre-stellar core and before the initiation of nuclear fusion in the central object which will eventually become a star. Protostars are classified into four groups: Class 0, Class I, Class II, and Class III.   |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1304   |  Pulsar planets   |  A planet orbiting a pulsar. The first such planet to be discovered was around a millisecond pulsar known as PSR 1257+12.     |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1306   |  Pulsars  |  A rotating neutron star that emits a radio beam that is centered on the magnetic axis of the neutron star. As the magnetic axis and hence the beam are inclined to the rotation axis, a pulse is seen every time the rotation brings the magnetic pole region of the neutron star into view. In this way the pulsar acts much as a light house does, sweeping a beam of radiation through space. The pulse or spin periods range from 1.4 milliseconds to 8.5 seconds. As neutron stars concentrate an average of 1.4 solar masses on a diameter of only 20 km, pulsars are exceedingly dense and compact, representing the densest matter in the observable Universe. The pulsar radiation, chiefly emitted in radio frequencies (0.1-1 GHz), is highly polarized. The exact mechanism by which a pulsar radiates is still a matter of vigorous investigation. Simply put, an enormous electric field is induced by the rotation of a magnetized neutron star. The force of this field exceeds gravity by ten to twelve orders of magnitudes. Charged particles are whereby pulled out from the stellar surface resulting in a dense, magnetized plasma that surrounds the pulsar (magnetosphere). The charged particles flow out of the magnetic polar caps of the neutron star, following the open magnetic field lines. The acceleration of the charged particles along the curved magnetic field lines will cause them to radiate.      |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1307   |  Pulsating variable stars     |  A type of variable star that changes its brightness by changing its volume through expansion and contraction. Classical pulsating stars, including Cepheids, RR Lyrae, and Delta Scuti variables, are located in a quite narrow almost vertical region in the H-R diagram, known as instability strip.   |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1309   |  Pulsation modes  |  The way in which pulsations occur in a star due to the fact that stars act as resonant cavities, as studied in asteroseismology. A star may pulsate either with approximately spherical symmetry (radial pulsation), or as a series of waves running across the surface (non-radial pulsation). Pulsation may occur in a single mode or in multiple modes, depending on the type of star. Three different modes of pulsations have been detected through the helioseismology of the Sun: p mode, g mode, and f mode, generated by acoustic, gravity, and surface gravity waves respectively.     |

Quasars have an intrinsic luminosity which can reach some 100 times that of bright galaxies. They are thought to be active galactic nuclei with a size a little larger than the solar system. The first quasar to be identified as such, in 1963, was the radio source 3C 273 at a redshift of 0.158. With its 13th magnitude, it is the optically brightest quasar as observed from Earth. Some quasars are strong radio sources.    |

Quintessence can have several types and differs from the cosmological constant in that it can vary in space and time. In modern physics, the four known "elements" are the baryons (proton, neutron, etc.), the leptons (neutrinos, electrons, etc.), the photon, and the hypothetical non-baryonic matter, which is thought to be 80% of the total matter in the Universe. The quintessence field is a possibility which can be confirmed or disproved by measurements of the dark energy value at different redshifts. In some models, the quintessence is fine-tuned to explain both the cosmological constant problem and the inflation in the very early Universe.     |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1324   |  R-process    |  A nucleosynthesis process in which chemical elements heavier than zinc are created through the intense bombardment of other elements by neutrons in rapid succession. The essential feature of the r-process is the release of great numbers of neutrons in a very short time (less than 100 seconds). The r-process is a 'rapid' version of the s-process, occurring in supernova core collapse and possibly when a neutron star merges with a black hole in a binary star.     |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1325   |  R associations   |  A stellar association containing a number of reflection nebulae. The stars are of low or intermediate mass and young, less than a million years old. They are still surrounded by patches of dust that reflect and absorb light from the interstellar cloud in which they formed. This type of association was first suggested by Sidney van den Bergh.  |

|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1368   |  Red giant branch     |  The evolutionary path of a star that has exhausted its available hydrogen content in the core, between the main-sequence turnoff and the helium flash.   |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1372   |  Red giant stars  |  A certain star of spectral type K or later that occupies the upper right portion of the H-R diagram. Red giants are evolved stars that have exhausted their hydrogen fuel in the core. They may have a luminosity up to 1000 times greater than main sequence stars of the same spectral type. Red giants belong to the luminosity class III or II (bright giants). They are luminous because of their great size, but have a relatively low surface temperature. All normal stars are expected to pass eventually through a red-giant phase as a consequence of stellar evolution. When a main sequence star has converted approximately 10% of its hydrogen to helium, nuclear reactions in the core stop (Schönberg-Chandrasekhar limit). The hydrostatic equilibrium is no longer maintained, and the core contracts while the outer layers expand and cool. This process produces the low surface temperature and large size (from 10 to 100 times that of the Sun) that characterize the red giant. In the core the temperature continues to rise. When it approaches 100,000,000 K helium will begin to fuse into carbon. Prominent bright red giants in the night sky include Aldebaran and Arcturus.    |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1375   |  Red supergiant stars     |  A supergiant star with spectral type K or M. Red supergiants are the largest stars in the Universe, but not necessarily the most massive. Betelgeuse and Antares are the best known examples of a red supergiant.    |

|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1381   |  Reflection nebulae   |  A type of nebula that is visible from its reflection of starlight. Bright stars near reflection nebulae emit light into the region that is reflected by the large amount of dust there. The size of the dust grains causes blue light to be reflected more efficiently than red light, so these reflection nebulae frequently appear blue in color.  |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1382   |  Refracting telescopes    |  A telescope in which an image is formed by the refraction of light through a lens or lens system.    |

|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1385   |  Relativistic aberration  |  The aberration of light for an object moving with relativistic speed. In contrast to the classical case, the Lorentz transformation between the rest frame of the observer and that of the object must be used. Relativistic aberration is expressed by the equation: cos φ' = (cos φ - )/(1 - cos φ.v/c), where φ is the classical aberration angle, v the speed of the Earth, and c the speed of light.    |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1394   |  Relaxation time  |  The characteristic length of time that is required for a system undergoing relaxation to move to its equilibrium state. If the system follows an exponential law G = G_0 exp(-t / τ), the relaxation time is the time required for G to obtain the fraction 1/e of its initial value G_0.    |

|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1400   |  Ring galaxies    |  A galaxy with a ring-like appearance around the central luminous center. The ring consists of massive, relatively young bright stars. It is believed that ring galaxies result from the head-on collision of two different galaxies.     |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1403   |  Ritchey-Chrétien telescopes  |  A type of Cassegrain telescope in which the primary mirror is a hyperboloid. It is designed to eliminate coma and spherical aberration, thus providing a relatively large field of view as compared to a more conventional configuration.    |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1404   |  Roche limit  |  The smallest distance at which a satellite under the influence of its own gravitation and that of a central mass about which it is describing a Keplerian orbit can be in equilibrium. This does not, however, apply to a body held together by the stronger forces between atoms and molecules. At a lesser distance the tidal forces of the primary body would break up the secondary body. The Roche limit is given by the formula d = 1.26 R_M (ρ_M/ρ_m)^(1/3), where R_M is the radius of the primary body, ρ_M is the density of the primary, and ρ_m is the density of the secondary body. This formula can also be expressed as: d = 1.26 R_m (M_M/M_m)^(1/3), where R_m is the radius of the secondary. As an example, for the Earth-Moon system, where R_M = 6,378 km, ρ_M = 5.5 g cm^(-3), and ρ_m = 2.5 g cm^(-3) is 1.68 Earth radii.   |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1405   |  Roche lobe   |  The region around a star in a binary system within which orbiting material is gravitationally bound to that star. The point at which the Roche lobes of the two stars touch is called the inner Lagrangian point.    |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1406   |  Rotating black holes     |  A black hole that possesses angular momentum, as first postulated by Roy C. Kerr in 1963. Opposite of a stationary black hole.   |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1410   |  RR Lyrae variable stars  |  A member of a large class of pulsating stars of type A2-F6 with periods less than 1 day. They are similar to Cepheids, except that their periods are much shorter and are less luminous. RR Lyrae stars belong to Population II and are often found in globular clusters (hence one of their older names cluster variables) or elsewhere in the galactic halo. They are used as distance indicators (standard candle) out to more than 200 kpc.  |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1417   |  Runaway stars    |  A massive, young, and hot star that is moving quickly through space. Runaways are probably propelled through space from a binary star when its companion has exploded as a supernova, or ejected from a stellar cluster by the dynamical interactions in the system.     |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1419   |  S-process    |  A nucleosynthesis process by which chemical elements heavier than copper are formed through a slow flux of neutrons absorbed by atomic nuclei (neutron-capture element). The capture of neutrons occurs on time scales that are long enough to enable unstable nuclei to decay via the emission of a beta particle before absorbing another neutron. Prominent s-process elements include barium, zirconium, and yttrium.    |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1420   |  S Doradus stars  |  A type of massive, blue supergiant, variable star, also known as a Hubble-Sandage variable or a Luminous Blue Variable (LBV).

|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1421   |  S stars  |  A red giant of spectral type S whose spectrum is dominated by molecular bands arising from zirconium oxide (ZrO). S stars also have strong cyanogen bands and contain spectral lines of lithium and technetium. Almost all S stars are long-period variables.    |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1423   |  Sagittarius dwarf spheroidal galaxy  |  A satellite galaxy of the Milky Way discovered only in 1994 since most of it is obscured by the Galactic disc. At only 50,000 light years distant from our Galaxy's core, it is travelling in a polar orbit around the Galaxy. Our Galaxy is slowly devouring it, as evidenced by a filament which stretches around the Milky Way's core like a gossamer loop. It is only about 10,000 light-years in diameter, in comparison to the Milky Way's diameter of 100,000 light years. It is populated by old yellowish stars has four known globular clusters: M54, Arp 2, Terzan 7, and Terzan 8. It should not be confused with the Sagittarius Dwarf Irregular Galaxy.    |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1424   |  Saros cycle  |  The period of 223 synodic month, equaling 6585.32 days or 18 years, 11.33 days, after which the Sun, Earth, and Moon return to approximately the same relative geometry. When two eclipses are separated by a period of one Saros, they occur at the same node with the Moon at nearly the same distance from Earth and at the same time of year. Thus, the Saros is a useful tool for organizing eclipses into families or series. Each series typically lasts 12 or 13 centuries and contains 70 or more eclipses.     |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1426   |  Saturn   |  The sixth planet from the Sun and the second largest with an equatorial diameter of 120,536 km orbiting at an average distance of 1,429,400,000 km (9.54 astronomical units) from Sun. With an eccentricity of 0.05555, its distance from the Sun ranges from 1.35 billion km (9.024 AU) at its perihelion to 1.509 billion km (10.086 AU) at its aphelion. Its average orbital speed being 9.69 km/s, it takes Saturn 29.457 Earth years (or 10,759 Earth days) to complete a single revolution around the Sun. However, Saturn also takes just over 10 and a half hours (10 hours 33 minutes) to rotate once on its axis. This means that a single year on Saturn lasts about 24,491 Saturnian solar days. Saturn has a mass of 5.6836 x 1026 kg (95.159 Earth masses) and a mean density of 0.687 g cm^(-3). Like Jupiter, Saturn is about 75% hydrogen and 25% helium with traces of water, methane, and ammonia, similar to the composition of the primordial Solar Nebula from which the solar system was formed. The temperature on Saturn is ~ -185 °C. Like Jupiter, Saturn has a solid core of iron-nickel and rock (silicon and oxygen compounds). The core has an estimated mass of 9-22 Earth Masses and a diameter of about 25,000 km (about 2 Earth diameter). The core is enveloped by a liquid metallic hydrogen layer and a molecular hydrogen layer. Saturn's interior is hot (12,000 K at the core). The planet radiates more energy into space than it receives from the Sun. Most of the extra energy is generated by the Kelvin-Helmholtz mechanism as in Jupiter. Saturn has 62 known satellites. Saturn's ring. On 1 July 2004 NASA/ESA's Cassini-Huygens became the first to orbit Saturn, beginning a 13 year mission that revealed many secrets and surprises about Saturn and its system of rings and moons.    |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1429   |  Scale height     |  The height within which some parameter, such as pressure or density, decreases by a factor of e. For example, an atmospheric scale height of 100 km means that the value at 100 km is 1/e the value at the surface.  |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1431   |  Schmidt-Cassegrain telescopes    |  A mixture of the Cassegrain telescope with a very short focal length and of a Schmidt design (due to the presence of the corrective plate), used mainly in amateur astronomy. The main advantage of this telescope is its compact design. However, Schmidt-Cassegrain telescopes produce fainter images with less contrast than other telescope designs with similar aperture sizes. This is due to the comparatively large secondary mirror required to reflect the light back the eyepiece.    |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1433   |  Schwarzschild black holes    |  A black hole with zero angular momentum (non-rotating) and zero electric charge derived from Karl Schwarzschild 1916 exact solution to Einstein's vacuum field equations.    |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1434   |  Schwarzschild metric     |  In general relativity, the metric that describes the space-time outside a static mass with spherically symmetric distribution.   |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1435   |  Schwarzschild radius     |  The critical radius at which a massive body becomes a black hole, i.e., at which light is unable to escape to infinity: R_s = 2GM / c^2, where G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass, and c the speed of light. The formula can be approximated to R_s ≅ 3 x (M/M_sun), in km. Therefore, the Schwarzschild radius for Sun is about 3 km and for Earth about 1 cm.  |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1436   |  Sculptor dwarf elliptical galaxy     |  A dwarf elliptical galaxy that is a satellite of our Milky Way. It lies about 285,000 light-years away in the constellation Sculptor, and has an absolute magnitude of -11.28 and a mass of about 3 million solar masses. The Sculptor Dwarf is a metal-deficient galaxy containing only 4 percent of the oxygen and carbon elements in our own Galaxy.  |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1438   |  Secondary cosmic rays    |  A burst of secondary charged and neutral particles arising when primary cosmic rays collide with the atmospheric oxygen or nitrogen nuclei in the upper atmosphere. The collision produces mostly pions (π), along with some kaons (K), antiprotons, and antineutrons. Neutral pions very quickly decay, usually into two gamma rays. Charged pions also decay but after a longer time. Therefore, some of the pions may collide with yet another nucleus of the air before decaying, which would be into a muon and a neutrino. The fragments of the incoming nucleus also interact again, also producing new particles.    |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1439   |  Secular parallax     |  The angle subtended at a star by a baseline that is the distance the Sun moves in a given interval of time with respect to the local standard of rest (4.09 AU per year).    |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1443   |  Semi-detached binary stars   |  A binary system whose secondary member fills its Roche lobe but whose primary member does not.   |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1444   |  Semi-regular variable stars  |  A type of giant or supergiant pulsating variable star, with intermediate or late spectra, showing noticeable periodicity in its light changes, accompanied or sometimes interrupted by various irregularities. Periods lie in the range from 20 to more than 2000 days, while the shapes of the light curve may be rather different and variable with each cycle. The amplitudes may be from several hundredths to several magnitudes (usually 1-2 magnitudes in the V filter). Examples are Betelgeuse, Antares, and Rasalgethi. Semiregular variables are classified in several subtypes: SRA, SRB, SRC, and SRD.  |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1445   |  Semimajor axis   |  Half the length of the major axis of an ellipse; a standard element used to describe an elliptical orbit.    |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1447   |  Seyfert galaxies     |  A member of an important class of active galaxies which are characterized by the presence of an intensely bright nucleus in the optical wavelengths (10^9-10^12 L_sun) displaying emission spectral lines. The presence of these emission features, which are not seen in the spectra of normal galaxies, indicates a very high degree of ionization. Moreover, the nucleus radiates non-thermal continuum emission extending over the whole electromagnetic spectrum. It is thought that a massive black hole in the nucleus of a galaxy accretes gas (accretion) from its surrounding environment to power Seyfert galaxies. These galaxies are divided into two types according to the width of their spectral lines. Type 1 Seyfert (Sy 1) galaxies have very broad emission lines (10^3 - 10^4 km s^-1), while Type 2 Seyferts (Sy 2) show relatively narrow lines (several hundred km s^-1). These spectral differences may be the result of viewing the nucleus from different angles. A Type 2 Seyfert galaxy may be a mostly edge-on view of matter spiraling in toward the supermassive black hole, whereas a Type 1 Seyfert provides a more pole-on view, allowing us to see the more turbulent region around the black hole.     |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1449   |  Shadow bands     |  Faint wavy lines of alternating light and dark that sometimes can be seen on flat, light-colored surfaces just before and just after a total solar eclipse. The phenomenon results from sunlight distortion by irregularities in the Earth's atmosphere.     |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1450   |  Shell burning    |  The nuclear reactions in a shell around a star's core that continue after the fuel in the core itself has been exhausted. As the fuel is progressively exhausted, the shell moves outward until it enters regions too cool for the reactions to continue. For example, after the exhaustion of hydrogen in the core, helium burning might take place in the core with a shell of hydrogen burning surrounding it. Stars may have more than one region of shell burning during their stellar evolution, each shell with its own nuclear reactions.    |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1451   |  Shepherd satellites  |  A natural satellite in orbit near the edge of a planetary ring, whose gravitational force on the ring particles strongly controls the distribution of material within the ring, creating ringlets and density waves within the ring and sharp edges at ring boundaries. Examples include Saturn's Prometheus and Pandora, which shepherd the narrow outer F ring and the Uranus satellites Cordelia and Ophelia and the epsilon ring. The faster-moving inside satellite accelerates the inner ring particles as it passes them, causing them to spiral out to larger orbits. At the same time the slower-moving outer satellite decelerates the outer ring particles as they pass by, causing them to spiral inward. The result is a narrow, well-defined ring.     |

|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1464   |  Sky surveys  |  The observation and recording of large extents of the sky with a particular instrument using one or more wavelengths in the same spectral domain.    |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1467   |  Slow novae   |  A type of nova whose light curve exhibits a characteristically slow development, having a rise time of several days, maximum of several weeks, and slower decline.   |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1468   |  Small Magellanic Cloud   |  An irregular galaxy, the smaller of the two Magellanic Clouds that are satellites of our own Galaxy, lying in the southern constellation Tucana about 20 degrees from the south celestial pole. The SMC covers an area roughly 3 by 5 degrees in dimension and has an overall visual magnitude about +2.7. The SMC is about 10,000 light-years in diameter and some 210,000 light-years (61 kpc) away. It has a visible mass of about 1/50-th that of our Galaxy and 1/10-th of that of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). Its heavy element content is about a factor 5 smaller than that of the Galaxy. The SMC is the third-nearest external galaxy after the Sagittarius Dwarf Spheroidal Galaxy and the LMC.     |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1469   |  Small Solar System bodies    |  A term introduced by the International Astronomical Union (August 2006) to name the solar system bodies other than planets and dwarf planets. Small solar system bodies include asteroids, comets, and meteoroids.   |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1475   |  Solar activity   |  The general term for all forms of short-lived phenomena on the Sun, including solar flares, sunspots, prominences, etc., indicating that the Sun is an active star.  |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1476   |  Solar physics    |  The branch of astrophysics concerned with the study of the physical properties of the Sun based on the most detailed observations which can be obtained for a star.  |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1481   |  Solar constant   |  The amount of solar radiation in all wavelengths received per unit of time per unit of area on a theoretical surface perpendicular to the Sun's rays and at Earth's mean distance from the Sun. Its mean value is 1367.7 W m^-2 or 1.37 x 106 erg sec^-1 cm^-2. In other words, the solar constant is the mean solar irradiance on the outer atmosphere when the Sun and Earth are spaced at 1 astronomical unit.    |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1483   |  Solar corona     |  The outermost atmosphere of the Sun immediately above the chromosphere, which can be seen during a total solar eclipse. It consists of hot, extremely tenuous gas extending for millions of kilometer from the Sun's surface.    |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1484   |  Solar coronal holes  |  An area in the solar corona which appears dark in X-rays and ultraviolet light. The gas density in these areas are very low, about 100 times less than that of coronal active regions. The magnetic field lines in a coronal hole extend out into interplanetary space rather than returning to the Sun's surface, as they do in other parts of the Sun (open magnetic field line). Ionized hot gas can escape easily along such a path, and this brings about high speed solar wind streams.    |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1485   |  Solar coronal loops  |  An arc-like structure in the Sun's corona that is found around sunspots and in active regions. These structures are associated with the closed magnetic field lines that connect magnetic regions on the solar surface. The loops are sometimes as high as 10,000 km with their two ends situated in photosphere regions of opposite magnetic polarity. This implies that the coronal loops are tubes of magnetic flux filled with hot plasma. They last for days or weeks but most change quite rapidly.    |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1486   |  Solar coronal streamers  |  A bright, narrow stream of particles traveling through the Sun's corona, visible in images taken with a coronagraph or during a total solar eclipse. Coronal streamers represent the most outwardly extended structures in the solar corona and result from the interaction between the solar slow wind and the large-scale magnetic field.  |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1487   |  Solar cycle  |  The periodic variation in frequency or number of solar active events (sunspots, prominences, flares, and other solar activity) occurring with an interval of about 11 years. The solar cycle was discovered in 1843 by Samuel Heinrich Schwabe (1789-1875), a German apothecary and amateur astronomer, who after 17 years of observations noticed a periodic variation in the average number of sunspots seen from year to year on the solar disk. Solar cycle numbering goes back to the 18th century, when the Cycle 1 peak occurred in 1760. Cycle 23 peaked in 2000, and the following Cycle 24 will reach its maximum in 2013.     |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1488   |  Solar radius     |  A unit of length, representing the radius of the Sun, used to express the size of stars in astrophysics. It is equivalent to: 695,700 km, 0.00465047 astronomical units, 7.35355 x 10^-8 light-years, and 2.32061 light-seconds.     |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1489   |  Solar eclipses   |  An eclipse in which the Earth passes through the shadow cast by the Moon. Solar eclipses only happen when the Moon is new and when the Moon lies close to the node of its orbit.     |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1494   |  Solar faculae    |  A bright area of the photosphere of the Sun visible in white light and best seen near the solar limb, although they occur all across the Sun. Faculae raise several hundred kilometers above the photosphere and are associated with sunspots. They often appear immediately before the formation of a sunspot group and remain visible for several days or weeks after the disappearance of the spots. Faculae are formed when a strong magnetic field heats a region of the photosphere to higher temperatures than the surrounding area.  |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1496   |  Solar flares     |  A bright eruption form the Sun's chromosphere in the vicinity of a sunspot. Solar flares are caused by tremendous explosions on the surface of the Sun. In a matter of just a few minutes they heat the material to many millions of degrees and release as much energy as a billion megatons of TNT.    |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1498   |  Solar granulation    |  The mottled appearance of the solar photosphere, caused by convective cells, resembling granules, which rises from the interior of the Sun. Each granule has a mean size of about 1,000 km and an upward velocity of about 0.5 km/sec. Granules are separated by intergranular walls about 400 K colder. They emerge from the fragments of the preceding granules and their lifetimes are about 20 minutes.  |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1499   |  Solar instruments    |  An instrument especially designed for solar observations.    |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1503   |  Solar magnetic fields    |  The Sun's magnetic field which is probably created by the differential rotation of the Sun together with the movement of charged particles in the convective zone. Understanding how the solar magnetic field comes about is the fundamental problem of Solar Physics. The solar magnetic field is responsible for all solar magnetic phenomena, such as sunspots, solar flares, coronal mass ejections, and the solar wind. The solar magnetic fields are observed from the Zeeman broadening of spectral lines, polarization effects on radio emission, and from the channeling of charged particles into visible coronal streamers. The strength of Sun's average magnetic field is 1 gauss (twice the average field on the surface of Earth, around 0.5 gauss), and can be as strong as 4,000 Gauss in the neighborhood of a large sunspot.  |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1506   |  Solar mass   |  The amount of mass in our Sun, about 330,000 times the Earth's mass. The solar mass is also the unit in which the masses of other stars, galaxies, and other large celestial bodies are expressed.   |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1508   |  Solar nebulae    |  The cloud of interstellar gas and dust from which the Sun and the rest of the solar system initially formed.     |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1509   |  Solar neighborhood   |  That part of the Milky Way galaxy lying near the Sun. In fact there is no definition of the exact radius of this region. It is referred to the immediate solar neighborhood (within about 5 pc), the solar neighborhood (within about 25 pc), and the extended solar neighborhood (within a few hundred pc).     |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1510   |  Solar neutrino problem   |  A major discrepancy between the flux of neutrinos detected at Earth from the solar core and that predicted by current models of solar nuclear fusion and our understanding of neutrinos themselves. The problem, lasting from the mid-1960s to about 2002, was a considerably lesser detected number of neutrons compared with theoretical predictions. The discrepancy has since been resolved by new understanding of neutrino physics, requiring a modification of the standard model of particle physics, in particular neutrino oscillation.    |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1511   |  Solar neutrinos  |  A neutrino generated in the Sun. The main source of solar neutrinos is the proton-proton chain of reactions, in which an energy of +28 MeV is shared between the reaction products. These are called low-energy neutrinos. There are less important reactions in the Sun yielding a smaller flux of higher energy neutrinos. The solar neutrino flux can be estimated from the solar luminosity.     |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1516   |  Solar parallax   |  The angle subtended (8''.79) by the equatorial radius of the Earth at a distance of 1 astronomical unit.     |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1518   |  Solar photosphere    |  The visible surface of the Sun (temperature 5700 K), just below the chromosphere and just above the convective zone. The solar photosphere is a thin layer of roughly 300 km wide. Its temperature decreases uniformly with height, from about 6,600 K (pressure 0.868 millibars) at its bottom, to about 4,400 K (pressure 125 mb), where it merges with the chromosphere. The photosphere has a 'rice-grain' appearance, called granulation, caused by rising (hot) and falling (cool) material in the convective cells just below the photosphere. Other main features of the photosphere are sunspots, faculae, and supergranulation.    |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1521   |  Solar radiation  |  All the constituents making up the Sun's emission: photons, electrons, protons, neutrinos, and atomic nuclei.    |

It rotates in the counterclockwise direction (when viewed from the north), the same direction that the planets rotate (and orbit around the Sun). The Sun's rotation is differential, i.e. the period varies with latitude on the Sun (differential rotation). Equatorial regions rotate in about 25.6 days. The regions at 60 degrees latitude rotate more slowly, in about 30.9 days.   |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1528   |  Solar system     |  The collective name for the Sun and all objects gravitationally bound to it. These objects are the eight planets, their 166 known moons, five dwarf planets, and billions of small bodies. The small bodies include asteroids, icy Kuiper belt objects, comets, meteoroids, and interplanetary dust. The solar system is roughly a sphere with a radius greater than 100,000 AU. Planets, satellites, and all interplanetary material together comprise only about 1/750 of the total mass. Geochemical dating methods show that the solar system chemically isolated itself from the rest of the Galaxy (4.7 ± 0.1) x 10^9 years ago.   |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1531   |  Solar telescopes     |  A telescope designed so that heating effects produced by the Sun do not distort the images.  |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1534   |  Solar wind   |  A mass outflow, consisting of protons, electrons, and other subatomic particles, expelled constantly from the solar corona at about 500 km per second. The solar mass-loss rate in this phenomenon amounts to about 2 x 10^-14 solar masses per year, or about 106 tons per second.  |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1537   |  Solstice     |  Either of the two points on the ecliptic at which the apparent longitude of the Sun is 90° or 270°. Also the time at which the Sun is at either point. Solstices occur when the Earth's axis is oriented directly toward or away from the Sun, causing the Sun to reach its northernmost and southernmost extremes.  |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1538   |  South celestial pole     |  The point in the southern hemisphere where the rotation axis of the Earth touches the celestial sphere. In contrast to the north celestial pole, no bright star is visible in that direction.    |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1542   |  Space debris     |  Man-made objects in orbit around the Earth that no longer serve any useful purpose. The estimated number of debris include about 22,000 tractable objects larger than 10 cm in all orbits, of which 2,200 are dead satellites and last stages of the rocket that put them in orbit. There are also left-overs from spacecraft and mission operations, such as bolts, lens caps, clamp bands, auxiliary motors, etc. The debris presents a threat because of their high speeds, which ranges between 15 and 20 km/sec. Also called space junk, space waste, orbital debris.   |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1545   |  Space probes     |  A spacecraft carrying instruments intended for use in exploration of the physical properties of outer space or celestial bodies other than Earth.    |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1547   |  Space telescopes     |  A telescope which is placed in an orbit around the Earth and operates through commands from sent from the control center on Earth, such as Hubble space telescope, Herschel satellite, Infrared Astronomical Satellite (IRAS), Infrared Space Observatory (ISO), International Ultraviolet Explorer (IUE), Planck Satellite, Spitzer Space Telescope.    |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1551   |  Special relativity   |  The theory formulated by A. Einstein in 1905, which is based on the following two postulates: 1) Principle of relativity: The laws of physical phenomena are the same when studied in terms of two reference systems moving at a constant velocity relative to each other. 2) Principle of constancy: The velocity of light in free space is the same for all observers and is independent of the relative velocity of the source of light and the observer.  The term 'special theory of relativity' refers to the restriction in the first postulate to reference systems moving at a constant velocity relative to each other (inertial reference frame).     |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1552   |  Speckle interferometry   |  A technique for generating a clear composite image of a celestial object blurred by atmospheric turbulence in which a large number of short-exposure photographs are mathematically correlated by a computer. By comparing the behavior of the speckles in a series of images it is possible to approach the theoretical resolution of the telescope.    |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1554   |  Spectrometers    |  A spectrograph in which the spectrum is recorded by electronic means so that wavelength, intensity, etc. can be measured.  An instrument for determining the distribution of energies in a beam of particles.    |

|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1558   |  Spectroscopy     |  The study of spectral lines from different atoms and molecules. Spectroscopy is an important part of studying the physical and chemical properties of astronomical objects.  |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1559   |  Spiral arms  |  The region in a spiral galaxy that contains concentrations of gas, dust, and  massive stars. Spiral arms are created by density waves.   |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1560   |  Spiral galaxies  |  A galaxy with a prominent nuclear bulge and luminous spiral arms of gas, dust, and young stars that wind out from the nucleus. Masses span the range from 10^10 to 10^12 solar masses.   |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1562   |  Spokes   |  In Saturn's rings, changing structures in the radial direction. It is thought that gravitational forces alone cannot account for the spoke structure, and it has been proposed that electrostatic repulsion between ring particles may play a role.  |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1564   |  Standard stars   |  Stars for which accurate color indices and/or magnitudes exist, defining a standard system.  |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1565   |  Star forming regions     |  A region in the interstellar medium where processes of star formation are going on or have occurred in the past.     |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1567   |  Star clusters    |  A group of stars held together by the mutual gravitational attraction of its members, which are physically related through common origin. They are of two types: open clusters and globular clusters.    |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1568   |  Star counts  |  The number of stars that appear in a given region of sky, usually counted on a photographic plate or CCD image.  |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1569   |  Star formation   |  The process by which dense parts of molecular clouds collapse into a ball of plasma to form a star. As a branch of astronomy, star formation includes the study of the interstellar medium and molecular clouds as precursors to the star formation process as well as the study of young stellar objects.   |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1570   |  Starburst galaxies   |  A galaxy showing a short-lived intense period of star formation that is unsustainable over the Hubble time due to the limited supply of gas within a galaxy. Starburst galaxies were first classified by Searle & Sargent (1972) and Searle et al. (1973), based on the blue colors produced by the massive stars formed during the burst. In the local Universe, starbursts create approximately 10% of the radiant energy and 20% of the massive stars. At z = 1, starburst characteristics are found in 15% of galaxies, presumably attributable to the greater amounts of gas typically present in young galaxies and increased galactic interactions. The starburst's impact on a galaxy and the surrounding intergalactic medium is primarily due to the consumption of gas that fuels the burst and the feedback from massive stars formed in the burst.  |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1572   |  Starspots    |  A phenomenon similar to a sunspot but occurring on the surface of a star other than Sun. Due to spatial resolution constraints, starspots so far observed are in general much larger than those on the Sun, up to about 30% of the stellar surface may be covered, corresponding to sizes 100 times greater than those on the Sun.   |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1573   |  Statistical parallax     |  The mean parallax of a group of stars that are all at approximately the same distance, as determined from their radial velocities and proper motions.    |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1582   |  Stellar associations     |  A large, loose grouping of 10 to 1000 stars that are of similar spectral type and share a common origin. The members move together through space, but have become gravitationally unbound. Stellar associations are primarily identified by their common movement vectors and ages.  |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1583   |  Stellar astronomy    |  The branch of astronomy that deals with the study of stars, their physical properties, formation, and evolution.     |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1589   |  Stellar classification   |  The systematic grouping of stars and stellar objects into categories on the basis of physical, morphological, or evolutionary characteristics.   |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1596   |  Stellar dynamics     |  The field of astrophysics that describes systems of many point mass particles whose mutual gravitational interactions determine their orbits. These systems include star clusters, globular clusters, and galaxies. Stellar dynamics deals with systems in which each member contributes importantly to the overall gravitational field and is usually concerned with the statistical properties of many orbits. It can be compared to the kinetic theory of gases developed in the late 19th century. In contrast, celestial mechanics deals with systems where the gravitational force of a massive planet or star determines the orbits of its satellites.    |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1599   |  Stellar evolution    |  The gradual changes in physical state (spectrum, luminosity, temperature) and chemical composition that occurs during the life of a star.    |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1602   |  Stellar feedback     |  The process whereby large quantities of energy and momentum are released into the gas surrounding star formation regions in galaxies. More specifically, massive stars inject energy, mass, and metals back to the interstellar medium through stellar winds and supernova explosions. Feedback inhibits further star formation either by removing gas from the galaxy, or by heating it to temperatures that are too high to form new stars. Observations reveal feedback in the form of galactic-scale outflows of gas in galaxies with high star formation rates, especially in the early Universe. Feedback in faint, low-mass galaxies probably facilitated the escape of ionizing radiation from galaxies when the Universe was about 500 million years old, so that the hydrogen between galaxies changed from neutral to ionized, a process called reionization.     |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1616   |  Stellar nucleosynthesis  |  The nuclear reaction process taking place inside stars, whereby chemical elements are produced from pre-existing nuclei heavier than hydrogen and helium.    |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1618   |  Stellar parallax     |  The apparent difference in the position of a celestial object as seen by an observer from two widely separated locations. The parallax of an object can be used to derive its distance. The relationship between the parallax angle  p (measured in seconds of arc) and the distance d (measured in astronomical units) is given by d = 206,264 / p. For a parallax angle p = 1'', the distance to the star would correspond to 206,264 AU. By convention, the distance unit parsec is defined to be equivalent to 206,264 AU. Therefore, the parallax relation takes the much simpler form: d (in pc) = 1/p (in seconds of arc). The first star whose parallax was measured was 61 Cygni (Bessel, 1838).    |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1620   |  Stellar photometry   |  The precise measurement of a star's brightness, usually through several specific wavelength bands.   |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1621   |  Stellar physics  |  The field of astrophysics concerned with the study of the physical characteristics of stars, more specifically their internal structure, physical processes taking place in their interiors, atmospheres, stellar winds, mass loss, interaction with the interstellar medium, as well as the physical laws governing star formation.     |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1629   |  Stellar rotation     |  The spinning of a star about its axis, due to its angular momentum. Stars do not necessarily rotate as solid bodies, and their angular momentum may be distributed non-uniformly, depending on radius or latitude. Thus the equator of the star can rotate at a different angular velocity than the higher latitudes. These differences in the rate of rotation within a star may have a significant role in the generation of a stellar magnetic field.     |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1640   |  Stratosphere     |  The second major layer of Earth's atmosphere, just above the troposphere and below the mesosphere, extending from about 20 km to 90 km above the Earth. It is characterized by little vertical increase in temperature.  |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1641   |  Strömgren photometry     |  A four-color stellar photometric system devised by B. Strömgren. It is based on measurements in the ultraviolet (3500 Å), violet (4100 Å), blue (4670 Å), and yellow (5470 Å) regions of the spectrum. The filters bandwidths are 340, 200, 160, and 240 Å respectively. Also known as Strömgren four-color photometry.  |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1642   |  Strömgren spheres    |  A theoretical sphere of ionized hydrogen created by energetic ultraviolet photons of a hot, massive star embedded in a uniform interstellar molecular cloud and lying at the center of the sphere.   |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1643   |  Strong gravitational lensing     |  A gravitational lensing phenomenon in which the image distortion is strong enough to be readily recognized, such as in the case of the Einstein cross or when giant luminous arcs show up in galaxy clusters (e.g. Abell 2218).  Opposite to weak gravitational lensing.     |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1646   |  Subgiant stars   |  A star with a lower absolute magnitude than a normal giant star of its spectral type. It is a star that has exhausted the hydrogen at its center and is evolving into a red giant. Subgiants are luminosity class IV.    |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1647   |  Submillimeter astronomy  |  The study of astronomical objects with submillimeter waves. As with millimeter-wave astronomy, this part of the spectrum is rich in lines emitted by interstellar molecules and dust.    |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1649   |  Summer solstice  |  The moment in the northern hemisphere when the Sun attains its highest declination of 23°26' (or 23°.44) with respect the equator plane. It happens when the Earth's axis is orientated directly toward the Sun, on 21 or 22 June. During the northern solstice the Sun appears to be directly overhead at noon for places situated at latitude 23.44 degrees north, known as the tropic of Cancer. The summer solstice can occur at any moment during the day. Two successive summer solstices are shifted in time by about 6 h. The summer solstice in the northern hemisphere is the winter solstice in the southern hemisphere.  |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1652   |  Sunspot number   |  A quantity which gives the number of sunspots at a given time. It is defined by the relationship R = k(10g + f), where R is the sunspot number, k is a constant depending on the observation conditions and the instrument used, g is the number of the groups and f is the number of individual spots that can be counted.  |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1653   |  Sunspots     |  An area seen as a dark patch on the Sun's surface. Sunspots appear dark because they are cooler (of about 4000 °C) than the surrounding photosphere (about 6000 °C). They range in size from a few hundred kilometers to several times the Earth's diameter and last from a few hours to a few months. Very small sunspots are called pores. The number of sunspots varies from maximum to minimum in about 11 years, the sunspot cycle. Their appearance during a cycle follows the Sporer law. A typical spot has a central umbra surrounded by a penumbra, although either features can exist without the other. Sunspots are associated with strong magnetic fields of 0.2 to 0.4 tesla. A given sunspot has a single magnetic polarity. The opposite polarity may be found in other sunspots or in the bright and diffuse facular region adjacent to the sunspot. The first recorded naked-eye sightings of sunspots were by Chinese astronomers in the first century B.C. Johannes Fabricius (1587-1617) was the first to argue that sunspots are areas on the solar surface.  |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1655   |  Super Earths     |  An extrasolar planet more massive than the Earth but less massive than 10 Earth masses. The first discovered super-Earth orbits an M4 V star named GJ 876. Its estimated mass is 7.5±0.7 Earth masses and it has an orbital period of 1.94 days. It is close to the host star, and the surface temperature is calculated to lie between 430 and 650 K.   |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1656   |  Superbubbles     |  A cavity hundreds of light-years across filled with a hot gas blown into the interstellar medium by multiple supernovae and stellar winds. Examples are the Local Bubble in the Orion Arm of the Milky Way and the N44 Superbubble in the Large Magellanic Cloud.    |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1657   |  Superclusters    |  An aggregation of clusters of galaxies. Superclusters are typically about one hundred million (10^8) light-years in diameter and contain tens of thousands of galaxies. Some examples are the Local Supercluster, Centaurus supercluster, Laniakea supercluster, Perseus-Pisces supercluster, Shapley supercluster, Virgo supercluster.      |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1658   |  Supergalactic coordinate system  |  A spherical coordinate system in which the equator is the supergalactic plane. Supergalactic longitude, SGL, is measured counterclockwise from direction l = 137.37 deg, b = 0 deg (between 0 and 360 deg). The zero point for supergalactic longitude is defined by the intersection of this plane with the Galactic plane. In the equatorial coordinate system (J2000) this is approximately 2.82 h, +59.5 deg. Supergalactic latitude, SGB, is measured from the supergalactic plane, positive northward and negative southward. The North Supergalactic Pole (SGB=90 deg) lies at galactic coordinates l = 47.37 deg, b = +6.32 degrees, corresponding to the equatorial coordinate system (J2000) 18.9 h, +15.7 deg.    |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1661   |  Supergiant stars     |  A star with maximum intrinsic brightness and low density. The radius of a supergiant star can be as large as 1000 times that of the Sun.     |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1663   |  Supermassive black holes     |  A black hole of tremendous mass, equivalent to those of millions or even billions of stars, which is believed to exist and occupy the centers of many galaxies. The supermassive black hole residing in the center of our Milky Way Galaxy is the object Sgr A* with a mass of 4 x 10^6 solar masses within a radius of 100 astronomical units.  |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1667   |  Supernova remnants   |  The body of expanding gas ejected at a speed of about 10,000 km s^-1 by a supernova explosion, observed as a diffuse gaseous nebula, often with a shell-like structure. Supernova remnants are generally powerful radio sources. The evolution of the SNR can be divided into different phases according to the dominant physical processes. Simplified models are made for the first stages, to get an idea of typical time scales, expansion velocities, and sizes. The three main phases are: 1) the free expansion phase, 2) the Sedov-Taylor phase, and 3) the snowplow phase.  |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1668   |  Supernovae   |  A violent stellar explosion which blows off all or most of the star's material at high velocity leaving a compact stellar remnant such as a neutron star or black hole. At maximum light, the supernova can have luminosity about 108 or 109 times the solar luminosity. The phenomenon results from the later evolution of stars when an instability sets in the core following the nucleosynthesis of iron. In massive stars, the supernova occurs when the star has used up all its available nuclear fuel and it reaches a lower energy state through gravitational collapse to form a more compact object. In white dwarfs forming binary systems, accretion of mass onto the surface of a neutron star can be sufficient to take the star over the upper mass limit for stability as a white dwarf. Consequently, the white dwarf collapses in a supernova explosion to form a neutron star. There are several supernova types.    |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1669   |  Surface gravity  |  The rate at which a small object in free fall near the surface of a body is accelerated by the gravitational force of the body: g = GM / R^2, where G is the gravitational constant, and M and R are the mass and radius of the object. The surface gravity of Earth is equal to 980 cm s^-2.    |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1674   |  Symbiotic binary stars   |  A stellar object whose optical spectrum displays lines characteristic of gases of two very different temperatures, typically of an M star (3500 K) and a B star (20 000 K) superimposed. A symbiotic star is in fact a close binary system.  |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1676   |  Synodic period   |  For planets, the mean interval of time between successive conjunctions of two planets, as observed from the Earth. For satellites, the mean interval between successive conjunctions of a satellite with the Sun, as observed from the satellite's primary.  |

|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1678   |  T associations   |  A stellar association containing many T Tauri stars. Examples include the Taurus-Auriga T association, the nearby TW Hydrae association, and Vela T1 and T2.     |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1679   |  T dwarfs     |  A type of brown dwarf with an effective temperature between about 1200 K and 500 K, i.e. colder than the preceding type L dwarf. The spectra of T dwarfs are characterized by the presence of methane bands in the near infrared. The presence of these bands, broad H_{2}O features, and H_2 collision-induced absorption radically alter the spectral energy distributions of T dwarfs compared to a black body at the same temperature. Hence near-infrared colors become increasingly blue (J - K ~ 0) as compared to L dwarfs. The first T dwarf, called Gl 229B, was discovered by Nakajima et al. The spectral classification scheme (subtypes T0 to T9) currently used was defined by Burgasser et al.   |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1681   |  T Tauri stars    |  A member of a class of young stellar objects of roughly 1 solar mass showing strong infrared excess emission attributed to circumstellar disks and found within or close to molecular clouds. T Tauri stars are protostars in the final stages of formation to become a stable main sequence star. The nuclear reactions in their core have not yet stabilized and the stars are known for the variability of their brightness.  |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1682   |  Tailed radio galaxies    |  A member of the class of radio galaxies that have a strong radio emission coming from a bright 'head' and a more diffuse emission from a 'tail.' They are often found in clusters.   |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1686   |  Tektites     |  Small glassy bodies whose chemical composition is unrelated to the geological formation in which they are found. They are found mostly in Australia, Java, Philippines and Indochina. Tektites are now thought to have been produced by the impact of meteorites on the earth's surface.     |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1689   |  Telescopes   |  An instrument used to collect and amplify light or other energy. Refracting telescopes gather light by means of a lens, reflecting telescopes by means of a mirror. Radio telescopes gather radio energy by using an antenna. Telescopes have also been built that can gather X rays, gamma rays, and other forms of energy.     |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1690   |  Termination shock    |  A shock wave inside the heliopause where the supersonic solar wind abruptly slows from an average speed of 500 km s^-1 to subsonic and becomes denser and hotter.    |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1692   |  The Moon     |  Natural satellite of the Earth. Mass 7.35 x 10^25 g = 1/81 or 0.0123 Earth's. Mean radius 1740 km = ~ 1/4 the Earth's; this relatively small size ratio makes the Earth-Moon system unique in the solar system. Mean density 3.34 g cm-3. Mean distance from Earth 384,400 km. Escape velocity 2.38 km s-1. Surface gravity 162.2 cm s-2 = 0.165 Earth's. Sidereal period 27d 7h 43m 11s. Eccentricity 0.0549. Inclination of orbital plane to ecliptic 5° 8' 43''. Obliquity 6° 41'. Synodic period 29d 12h 44m 2s.9. Orbital velocity 1.02 km s-1. The Moon's average visual albedo is 0.12, a factor of three smaller than that of Earth. The Moon's center of mass is displaced about 2 km in the direction of Earth. The average temperature on the surface of the Moon during the day is 107 °C. During the night, the average temperature drops to -153 °C. Studies of lunar rock have shown that melting and separation must have begun at least 4.5 x 109 years ago, so the crust of the Moon was beginning to form a very short time after the solar system itself. Thickness of crust ~ 60 km; of mantle ~ 1000 km. Temperature of core ~ 1500 K. It would have taken only 107 years to slow the Moon's rotation into its present lock with its orbital period. Because of this synchronous rotation, the Moon revolves once on its axis each time it orbits the Earth, thus always presenting the same face, the nearside, toward Earth. The Moon may have formed during a collision between the early Earth and a Mars-sized rocky planet about 4.6 billion years ago; Theia.   |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1693   |  The Sun  |  The star that governs the solar system. It is a yellow main-sequence star of spectral type G2, shines with apparent magnitude -26.74, and has an absolute magnitude of +4.83. The Sun is 4.6 billion years old and lies 27,000 light-years from the Galactic center.     |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1694   |  Thermosphere     |  The region of the upper atmosphere in which temperature increases continuously with height, starting at roughly 100 km. The thermosphere includes the exosphere and most of the ionosphere.  |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1695   |  Three-body problem   |  The mathematical problem of studying the positions and velocities of three mutually attracting bodies (such as the Sun, Earth and Moon) and the stability of their motion. This problem is surprisingly difficult to solve, even in the simple case, called restricted three-body problem, where one of the masses is taken to be negligibly small so that the problem simplifies to finding the behavior of the mass-less body in the combined gravitational field of the other two.    |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1696   |  Tidal disruption     |  The disruption of an extended astronomical object under the action of the tidal forces exerted by another nearby object.     |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1698   |  Tidal friction   |  The friction exerted on a primary body (Earth) because of the phase lag between the tides and the gravitational attraction of the secondary body (Moon). The Earth's rotation is faster than the Moon's orbital motion; therefore the Earth's tidal bulges lead the Moon on its orbit. This has two important effects: The Earth is being pulled slightly 'back' from its sense of rotation. So the Earth's rotation slows (by about 1 second every 50,000 years). Moreover, the Moon is being pulled slightly 'forward' on its orbit. So it is harder for the Earth to hold it in place, and it moves further away from the Earth (by about 3-4 cm per yr). Tidal friction tends to synchronize the rotation period of a close-in companion with the period of its orbital motion around the primary.   |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1701   |  Tidal tails  |  A long stream of stars and gas, often in the form of a spectacular tail, thrown off a galaxy when it collides with another galaxy. Two tidal tails form in each galaxy, and they are more spectacular when the masses of the two galaxies are comparable, and when their relative orbit is in the same sense as the rotation inside each spiral galaxy.  |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1704   |  Total eclipses   |  An eclipse in which the whole of the disk of the Sun or Moon is obscured.    |

|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1711   |  Transits     |  An event where one astronomical object appears to move across the face of another. As seen from Earth, the planets Venus and Mercury are seen to transit the Sun. We can also observe natural satellites transit the face of their host planet. Similarly exoplanets have been observed to transit their host stars.     |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1712   |  Triangulum Galaxy    |  One of the prominent members of the Local Group situated in the constellation Triangulum. Also known as NGC 598. M33 is a type Sc spiral galaxy seen nearly face-on. It lies 2.8 million light-years away and its diameter is 52,000 light-years. M33 is thought to be a satellite of the Andromeda Galaxy.  |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1713   |  Trigonometric parallax   |  The parallax of a nearby star (less than 300 light-years) against the background of more distant stars resulting from the motion of the Earth in its orbit around the Sun.   |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1715   |  Trojan asteroids     |  A member of the family of asteroids that share Jupiter's orbit and lie in elongated, curved regions around the two Lagrangian points 60° ahead and behind of Jupiter. The Lagrangian points L4 and L5 host several thousands of them. Originally, the term Trojan applied only to asteroids sharing Jupiter's orbit; however, planetoidal bodies have been discovered at the Lagrangian points of Mars and Neptune as well, and are also referred to as Mars Trojans and Neptune Trojans respectively.   |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1717   |  Tropopause   |  The boundary between the troposphere and stratosphere. Its height, varying with latitude and seasons, is from 8 km at poles, to 18 km at equator; it is higher during winter time. The atmospheric temperature decreases from ground upward until the tropopause. Then it increases in stratosphere because of the absorption of solar ultraviolet radiation.    |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1718   |  Troposphere  |  The lower part of the Earth's atmosphere in which temperature decreases with height, except for local areas of temperature inversion.    |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1719   |  True anomaly     |  One of the standard orbital elements, which is the angle measured at the focus nearest the periapsis of an elliptical orbit, between the periapsis and the radius vector from the focus to the orbiting body.    |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1720   |  True position    |  The coordinates of an object for a given date, with respect to the true equator and the true equinoxes for the instant of time in question.  |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1721   |  Turnoff point    |  The point on the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram of a star cluster at which stars begin to leave the main sequence and move toward the red giant branch. The main-sequence turnoff is a measure of age. In general, the older a star cluster, the fainter the main-sequence turnoff.     |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1722   |  Twilight     |  The diffused light from the sky when the Sun is below the horizon, either from daybreak to sunrise or, more commonly, from sunset to nightfall. There are three types of twilight: astronomical twilight, civil twilight, and nautical twilight. They are divided on the basis of the solar depression angle.    |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1723   |  Two-body problem     |  In classical mechanics, the study concerned with the dynamics of an isolated system of two particles subject only to the Newtonian gravitational force between them. The problem can be separated into two single-particle problems with the following solutions. The equation of the center of mass is governed by the equation of the same form as that for a single particle. Moreover, the motion of either particle, with respect to the other as origin, is the same as the motion with respect to a fixed origin of a single particle of reduced mass acted on by the same internal force.    |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1724   |  Two-color diagrams   |  A graph on which two color indices such as B-V and U-B are plotted, one along each axis, for a sample of stars or other objects, such as stars.  |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1728   |  Type Ia supernovae   |  A Type I supernova that presents a singly-ionized silicon (Si II) absorption feature at 6150 Å near peak brightness. Type Ia SNe are believed to result from mass accretion to a carbon-oxygen white dwarf in a close binary system. When the white dwarf mass exceeds the Chandrasekhar limit, the degenerate electron pressure can no longer support the accumulated mass and the star collapses in a thermonuclear explosion producing a supernova. The peak luminosity of SNe Ia is set by the radioactive decay chain, and the observed photometric correlation between the peak luminosity and the time-scale over which the light curve decays from its maximum is understood physically as having both the luminosity and opacity being set by the mass of Nickel-56 synthesized in the explosion. Type Ia supernovae occur in all types of galaxies. Type Ia SNe are used as standard candles in determining cosmological distances, after normalizing their light curves with the Phillips relation.   |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1729   |  Type Ib supernovae   |  A Type I supernova that has neutral helium line (He I) at 5876 Å, and no strong silicon (Si II) absorption feature at 6150 Å. Type Ib supernovae are believed to result from the evolution of massive stars.     |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1730   |  Type Ic supernovae   |  A Type I supernova that shows weak or no helium lines and no strong silicon (Si II) absorption feature near 6150 Å. Type Ic supernovae are believed to result from the evolution of massive stars.   |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1731   |  Type II supernovae   |  A supernova type whose spectrum contains hydrogen lines. Compared with Type I supernovae, its light curve has a broader peak at maximum and dies away more rapidly. The magnitudes are smaller, ranging from M_V = -12 to -13.5, and the ejecta have lower velocities (about 5,000 km/sec). These supernovae, which result from the final evolution of massive stars, have three main divisions: Type II-P, Type II-L, and Type II-n.    |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1733   |  Ultra-high-energy cosmic radiation   |  A particle belonging to the most energetic population of cosmic rays with an energy above ~10^20 electron-volts. The UHECRs constitute a real challenge for theoretical models, because their acceleration requires extreme conditions hardly fulfilled by known astrophysical objects.  |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1734   |  Ultracompact dwarf galaxies  |  A type of very bright compact stellar system (-14 ≤ MV ≥ -12) that is intermediate between globular clusters (GCs) and compact elliptical galaxies (cEs). With masses of M > 2 x 10^6 M_sun and radii > 10 parsecs (pc), UCDs are among the densest stellar systems in the Universe. Nevertheless, the nature and origin of these objects is still widely debated. Early interpretations suggested that UCDs could be the most massive GCs or possibly the tidally stripped remnants of dwarf galaxies. However, there is evidence that both formation mechanisms could contribute to the UCD population. Supermassive black holes (SMBHs) have been confirmed in most UCDs with masses M > 10^7 M_sun. The most massive UCD discovered to date, M59-UCD3 (M_* ~2 x 10^8 M_sun, radius ~ 25 pc), hosts a SMBH.   |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1735   |  Ultraluminous infrared galaxies  |  A galaxy that emits more than 90% of its energy in the infrared (8-1000 µm) and whose infrared luminosity exceeds 10^12 solar luminosities. Quasars can also have such high or even higher bolometric luminosities. However LIRGs and ULIRGs emit the bulk of their energy in the infrared. Most of ULIRGs are found in merging and interacting galaxy systems. It is thought that their luminosity results from galactic collisions, which increase the rate of star formation.     |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1736   |  Ultraviolet astronomy    |  The study of astronomical objects in the ultraviolet portions of the electromagnetic spectrum, in the waveband 3000 Å to about 10 Å. At these wavelengths, the atmosphere prevents ultraviolet radiation from reaching the Earth surface. Therefore ground-based observatories cannot observe in the ultraviolet. Only with the advent of space-based telescopes has this area of astronomy become available for research.   |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1744   |  Umbra    |  A dark area, especially the blackest part of a shadow from which all light is cut off.   |

|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1751   |  Uranus   |  The seventh planet from the Sun and the third largest, discovered by William Herschel in 1781. It has a diameter about 51,100 km, four times that of the Earth, and a mass 14.5 times Earth's mass. Uranus orbits the Sun at a distance over 19 times the Earth-Sun distance. Although it takes about 84 years for Uranus to make a revolution, it completes a fast rotation in only 17 and a half hours. Unlike the other planets, its axis of rotation lies mostly in the plane of the Solar System. Uranus is internally less active than the other giant planets, which added to its larger distance from the Sun, makes it colder. It has a dense atmosphere made of mostly molecular hydrogen (83 percent) and helium (15 percent), with two percent methane and traces of acetylene and other hydrocarbons. The planet's greenish-blue color is due to light scattering as in Earth's sky and the absorption of red light by its small amount of atmospheric methane. Uranus has a ring system and 27 known satellites.   |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1752   |  Urca process     |  A cycle of nuclear reactions, primarily among the iron group of elements, accompanied by a high rate of neutrino formation. Neutrinos carry away energy quickly leading to the cooling of the stellar core and a dramatic drop in the pressure. Due to this process in pre-supernova stars, the core becomes unable to support the weight of the overlying layers. These layers collapse onto the core and subsequently rebound and escape in the supernova explosion.   |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1758   |  Van Allen radiation belts    |  The ring-shaped regions of charged particles surrounding the Earth from 1 to 6 Earth radii into space. The charged particles are trapped in by the Earth's magnetic field. The inner belt is between 1.2 and 4.5 Earth radii and contains high-energy electrons and protons which originate mainly from interactions between cosmic rays and the upper atmosphere. The outer belt, located between 4.5 and 6.0 Earth radii, contains lower-energy charged particles mainly coming from the solar wind.   |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1763   |  Venus    |  The second planet from the Sun, at a mean distance of roughly 108.21 x 10^6 km (0.72 astronomical units). The greatest elongation of Venus is about 47°, making it visible at most about 3 hours after sunset or before sunrise. Venus has the most circular orbit of any planet in the solar system. Venus is only slightly smaller than Earth (95% of Earth's diameter, 80% of Earth's mass). Its chemical composition and density are comparable to those of the Earth. It takes Venus just under 224.401 days to orbit the Sun, compared to the 365 day orbital period of the Earth. Venus' rotation is retrograde, that is it actually rotates from east to west, as opposed to west to east (prograde) which is the common rotating direction of most other planets. Seen from Venus, the sun would rise in the west and set in the east. Moreover, it takes about 244 Earth days for Venus to rotate once (sidereal rotation). This is longer than its orbital period. The length of its solar day is about 117 Earth days. Venus rotation. Its axial tilt is only three degrees, so there are no seasons on Venus. The atmosphere on the surface of Venus consists mostly of carbon dioxide, with a small trace of nitrogen. Venus has a surface pressure about 90 times that of the Earth.  |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1764   |  Vernal equinox   |  The point of intersection between the ecliptic and the celestial equator at which the Sun passes from south to north of the celestial equator during its apparent annual motion. The instant of this event. It occurs on March 20, 21 or rarely 19. At the vernal equinox, as with the autumnal equinox, night and day are equal in length world over. Several thousands years ago the vernal equinox was in Aries, but because of precession it has now slid west into Pisces. Right ascension and celestial longitude are measured from the vernal equinox.    |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1765   |  Vertical circle  |  The greater circle on the celestial sphere which passes through zenith, nadir, and the star and whose plane is perpendicular to the plane of horizon.    |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1766   |  Very Large Array     |  A radio interferometer consisting of 27 antennas, each 25 m in diameter, in a Y-shaped configuration. It is located about 100 km west of Socorro, New Mexico, and is operated by the United States National Radio Astronomy Observatory. The VLA has the resolution of a single antenna 36 km wide and the sensitivity of a dish 130 m across.   |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1767   |  Very Large Telescope     |  An observing facility consisting of four 8.2 m telescopes, with the combined collecting area of a 16 m mirror, owned and operated by the European Southern Observatory at an altitude of 2635 m at the Paranal Observatory in Chile. The four reflecting unit telescopes are called Antu 'Sun' in the language of Chile's indigenous Mapuche people, Kueyen 'Moon,' Melipal 'Southern Cross,' and Yepun 'Venus.' Each unit is equipped with several sophisticated instruments. The light of the individual telescopes can be combined using interferometric techniques to achieve superior resolution.  The wavelength range covered by the VLT is extremely wide, ranging from deep ultraviolet to mid-infrared.    |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1769   |  Very long baseline interferometry    |  A technique in radio interferometry in which the individual telescopes are not directly connected together, but instead make their observations separately with very accurate timings. The data are later sent to a central correlator to be combined. With this technique the individual telescopes can be arbitrarily far apart, and so the technique provides the highest resolution images in astronomy, typically down to a few milliarcseconds.    |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1772   |  Virgo Cluster    |  The largest and nearest galaxy cluster to the Local Group. The Virgo cluster spans 120 square degrees on the sky and contains on the order of 2,000 galaxies. It is located at a distance of about 60 million light-years. It is an irregular cluster with no central concentration. The giant elliptical galaxy M87 is the most massive in the cluster.     |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1773   |  Virgo Supercluster   |  The irregular supercluster that contains the Virgo cluster and the Local Group. At least 100 galaxy groups and clusters are located within its diameter of 110 million light-years. It is one of millions of superclusters in the observable Universe.   |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1775   |  Visibility function  |  The Fourier transform of a source's brightness distribution, weighted by the characteristics of the interferometer's antennas.   |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1776   |  Optical astronomy    |  Optical astronomy is the part of astronomy that uses optical instruments (mirrors, lenses, and solid-state detectors) to observe light from near-infrared to near-ultraviolet wavelengths. Visible-light astronomy, using wavelengths detectable with the human eyes (about 400–700 nm), falls in the middle of this spectrum.   |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1779   |  Voids    |  A large region of cosmic space without galaxies. The first of these voids to be discovered lies in the direction of Bootes and is some 300 million light-years across. It is estimated that voids take up about 98% of the volume of the Universe, with clusters of galaxies concentrated in the thin walls that surround them.  |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1780   |  Volcanoes    |  An opening in the Earth's crust from which lava, ash, and hot gases flow or are ejected during an eruption.  |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1781   |  von Zeipel theorem   |  A theorem that establishes a relation between the radiative flux at some colatitude on the surface of a rotating star and the local effective gravity (which is a function of the angular velocity and colatitude). For a rotating star in which centrifugal forces are not negligible, the equipotentials where gravity, centrifugal force, and pressure are balanced will no longer be spheres. The theorem states that the radiative flux is proportional to the local effective gravity at the considered colatitude, F(θ) ∝ g_eff (θ)α, where α is the gravity darkening coefficient. As a consequence, the stellar surface will not be uniformly bright, because there is a much larger flux and a higher effective temperature at the pole than at the equator (T_eff (θ) ∝ g_eff (θ)β, where β is the gravity darkening exponent. In massive stars this latitudinal dependence of the temperature leads to asymmetric mass loss and also to enhanced average mass loss rates.    |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1784   |  W Virginis variable stars    |  A member of a class of pulsating stars with a period of 1 to 35 days located in the instability strip of the H-R diagram. Also known as type II Cepheid variables, W Virginis stars are typically 1.5 mag fainter than classical Type I Cepheids and have a mass less than that of the Sun. They also exhibit a period-luminosity relation which is distinct, but works in a similar way to the relation for Type I Cepheids. Hence W Virginis stars can also be used to measure Galactic and extragalactic distances.   |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1785   |  Walraven photometry  |  A photometric system with five wavelength ranges that does not use filters. Instead it uses prisms and lenses (spectroscopy) to select the bands simultaneously. The wavelengths and the bandwidths are: W, 3250 and 140 Å; U, 3630 and 240 Å; L, 3840 and 230 Å; B, 4320 and 450 Å; and V, 5470 and 720 Å. The Walraven photometer was unique in design and remained literally unique as copies were never built. In addition, during its whole life the photometer was mounted permanently on the same telescope that had been built specifically for this instrument, the 91 cm 'Lightcollector' reflector, which started in 1958 at the Leiden Southern Station in Broederstroom, South-Africa. After 20 years in South-Africa the telescope and photometer were moved to the European Southern Observatory La Silla observatory in Chile. The photometric observations were resumed in March 1979 and continued for another 12 years until the decommissioning of the photometer in 1991.   |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1786   |  Warm-hot intergalactic medium    |  The space containing a cluster of galaxies filled with a tenuous gas of temperature 105 to 107 K and density 10-6 to 10-4 cm-3. WHIM has been continuously shock-heated during the process of structure formation. It is so highly ionized that it can only absorb or emit far-ultraviolet and soft X-ray photons, primarily at spectral lines of highly ionized C, O, Ne, and Fe. WHIM is thought to be the main reservoir of missing baryons.  |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1790   |  Water masers     |  An interstellar maser phenomenon in which water (H_{2}O) molecules undergo the processes of population inversion and stimulated emission. H_{2}O masers are detected toward star formation regions and the envelopes of evolved stars. The maser emission comes from regions that are typically quite small, not larger than the solar system. The main emission frequency is 22 GHz, which shows up in strong lines. There are, however, other H_{2}O maser transitions at 380 GHz and 183 GHz, which are much weaker than the 22 GHz line. The former transitions are sporadically detected since they are strongly absorbed in the Earth's atmosphere, because of its high water vapor content.   |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1791   |  Water vapor  |  Water in the gaseous state. Atmospheric water in vapor form; one of the most important components of the atmosphere.     |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1793   |  WC stars     |  A Wolf-Rayet star whose spectrum is dominated by emission lines of ionized carbon: C III 5696 Å, C III / C IV 4650 Å, C IV 5801-12 Å. This type is divided in sub-types WC4 to WC9.  |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1795   |  Weak-line T Tauri stars  |  A T Tauri star that lacks strong emission lines in its optical spectrum, and lacks both strong stellar wind and infrared excess. These objects are believed to be pre-main sequence stars without obvious signs for disk accretion. Weak-line T Tauri stars result from the evolution of classical T Tauri stars.    |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1797   |  Weak gravitational lensing   |  A gravitational bending of light by structures in the Universe that distorts the images of distant galaxies. The distortion allows the distribution of dark matter and its evolution with time to be measured, thereby probing the influence of dark energy on the growth of structures. Weak gravitational lensing is generally difficult to identify in individual images, in contrast to strong gravitational lensing.    |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1799   |  White dwarf stars    |  A compact star of high surface temperature, low luminosity, and high density (10^5 - 10^8 g cm^-3), with roughly the mass of the Sun (mean mass ~ 0.6 M_sun) and the radius of the Earth (R ~ 0.01 R_sun), representing the end-point of the evolution of all stars with masses less then ~ 5-9 solar masses. A white dwarf is what remains after the central star of a planetary nebula fades and becomes cool. The Chandrasekhar limit of 1.43 solar masses is the highest mass that a white dwarf can achieve before electron degeneracy pressure is unable to support it. In the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, white dwarfs form a well-defined sequence around 8 magnitudes fainter than the main sequence. They are composed of a core of carbon and oxygen nuclei and degenerate electrons surrounded by a thin shell of helium and an outer skin of hydrogen. White dwarf's radiation is the leftover heat from the star's past when its core was an active nuclear reactor. The star slowly cools as heat escapes through the non-degenerate envelope. The first white dwarf to be discovered was Sirius B, the companion of Sirius. White dwarfs are divided into several types, according to their spectral features, which depend on the type of shell burning that dominated as it became a planetary nebula: DA white dwarf; DB white dwarf; DC white dwarf; DO white dwarf; DZ white dwarf; DQ white dwarf.    |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1801   |  Wide binary stars    |  A binary system with semi-major axis as large as 10,000 astronomical units.  |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1803   |  Wilson effect    |  A phenomenon in which the shape of sunspots flattens as they approach the Sun's limb due to the solar rotation. More specifically, when a sunspot approaches the solar limbs the width of the penumbra, relative to the umbra, on the side facing the center of the Sun seems to become narrower than on the side facing the limb. This phenomenon arises from a projection effect, and is due to a geometrical depression (the Wilson depression) in the layers of constant optical depth in sunspots.  |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1804   |  Winter solstice  |  The moment in the northern hemisphere when the Sun attains its lowest declination of -23°26' (or -23°.44) with respect the equator plane. It happens when the Earth's axis is orientated directly away from the Sun, on 21 or 22 December. During the northern winter solstice the Sun appears to be directly overhead at noon for places situated at latitude 23.44 degrees south, known as the tropic of Capricorn. The winter solstice can occur at any moment during the day. Two successive winter solstices are shifted in time by about 6 h. The winter solstice in the northern hemisphere is the summer solstice in the southern hemisphere.    |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1805   |  WN stars     |  A Wolf-Rayet star whose spectrum is dominated by emission lines of ionized nitrogen: N II 3995 Å, N III 4634-4661 Å, N III 5314 Å, N IV 3479-3484 Å, N IV 4058 Å, N V 4603 Å, N V 4619 Å, and N V 4933-4944 Å. This type is divided in sub-types WN2 to WN11.    |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1806   |  Wolf-Rayet stars     |  A type of very luminous, very hot (as high as 50,000 K) stars whose spectrum is characterized by broad emission lines (mainly He I and He II), which are presumed to originate from material ejected from the star at very high (~ 2000 km s^-1) velocities. The most massive O stars (M > 25 solar masses for solar metallicity) become W-R stars around 2 and 3 million years after their birth, spending only some few hundreds of thousands of years (≤ 10^6 years) in this phase until they explode as type Ib and type Ic supernovae. The minimum stellar mass that an O star needs to reach the W-R phase and its duration is dependent on metallicity.   |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1808   |  Wormholes    |  A hypothetical topological feature, based on general relativity, that connects two different points like a 'tunnel' in space-time. The most common concept of a wormhole is an Einstein-Rosen bridge. A trip through the wormhole could take much less time than a journey between the same starting and ending points in normal space. Wormholes have various types, intra-universe wormholes (connecting two distant regions of our Universe with each other) and inter-universe wormholes (that connect our Universe with another universe).  |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1809   |  WZ Sagittae stars    |  A subclass of dwarf novae with an extremely long outburst period, comparable with that of a recurrent nova.  |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1810   |  X-ray astronomy  |  The study of celestial bodies using their X-ray emission. X-ray astronomy deals mainly with Galactic and extragalactic phenomena involving very high-energy photon emissions, covering a band of energies between 0.1 keV and 500 keV. The research field includes: X-ray binaries, cataclysmic variables, pulsars, black holes, dark matter, active galaxies, galactic clusters X-ray transients. The Earth's atmosphere absorbs most X-rays coming from outer space. X-ray astronomy therefore requires observations to be done above atmosphere. The first rocket flight which successfully detected a cosmic source of X-ray emission was launched in 1962 by an American research group. A very bright source was detected that they named Scorpius X-1. Since then several dedicated X-ray astronomy satellites have been launched, among which: Uhuru, INTEGRAL, ROSAT, Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE), Chandra X-ray Observatory, and XMM-Newton, which have contributed to important advances in astronomy.     |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1811   |  X-ray binary stars   |  A binary star system where one of the stars has evolved and collapsed into an extremely dense body such as a white dwarf, a neutron star, or a black hole. The enormous gravitational attraction of the massive, dense, but dim component pulls material from the brighter, less massive star in an accretion disk. The gravitational potential energy of the accreted matter is converted to heat by viscosity and eventually to high-energy photons in the X-ray range. The brightest X-ray binary is Scorpius X-1.    |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1814   |  X-ray bursts     |  A rapid and intense surge of X-ray emission from some sources. They often last less than one second followed by an exponential decrease of typically a few seconds to a minute. Most X-ray bursts are believed to arise in X-ray binary systems due to nuclear fusion of material accreted onto a compact companion.     |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1822   |  X-ray sources    |  An astronomical object whose dominant mechanism of radiation is through X-ray emission. X-ray sources contain an extremely hot gas at temperatures from 10^6 to 10^8 K. They are generated by various physical processes involving high energies, such as accretion on to a compact object, shock waves from supernovae, stellar winds, hot gas in stellar coronae, or hot spaces between galaxies in a cluster. The first celestial X-ray source, after the Sun, to be detected was Scorpius X-1 by means of rocket flight.     |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1825   |  X-ray telescopes     |  A telescope designed to focus X-rays from astronomical objects. X-ray telescopes function from orbital satellites because X-rays are absorbed by the Earth's atmosphere. These telescopes require special techniques since the conventional methods used in optical and radio telescopes are not adequate.   |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1826   |  Xenobiology  |  The study of synthesizing and manipulating biological devices and systems.   |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1827   |  Y dwarfs     |  A type of ultra-cool brown dwarf with an effective temperature lower than 500 K. Near infrared spectra of these objects show deep absorption bands of H_{2}O and CH_4. So far only seven brown dwarf candidates belonging to this class have been found, all Y0 subtypes. These objects are very dim, with H magnitudes 19-23.  The precise definition of the Y class requires new findings in the future about these objects.   |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1828   |  Yellow hypergiant stars  |  An evolved, very massive star of spectral type F or G with a very high luminosity (~10^5 times solar) lying near the empirical upper luminosity boundary in the H-R diagram (Humphreys-Davidson limit). Yellow hypergiants have high mass loss rates (10^-5 - 10^-3 solar masses per year) and are in a short, transitional evolutionary stage. Their evolutionary state is thought to correspond to post-red supergiants rapidly evolving in blueward loops in the H-R diagram. In their post-RSG blueward evolution these stars enter a temperature range (6000-9000 K), called yellow void, with increased dynamical instability. Their link to other advanced evolutionary phases of massive stars such as Luminous Blue Variables and Wolf-Rayet stars is still an open issue in stellar evolution theory. The most famous yellow hypergiant is Rho Cassiopeiae.    |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1834   |  Young stellar objects    |  Any star that has evolved past the protostar stage, but has not yet arrived on the main sequence. There is a variety of YSOs depending on their age, mass, and environment, including Herbig stars, T Tauri stars, and, in general, compact infrared sources embedded in molecular clouds.   |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1838   |  Zenith   |  The point on the celestial sphere directly above the observer's head, opposite to the direction in which gravity acts. Opposite of nadir.    |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1839   |  Zenith hourly rate   |  The number of meteors expected to be seen under ideal conditions if the radiant of the meteoroid stream is at the zenith of the observer.    |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1840   |  Zenith telescopes    |  A telescope that is mounted on a vertical axis or moves only a small amount from the vertical. It is primarily used to determine positional measurement of stars moving near the zenith. The advantage is that there is no atmospheric refraction occurring at the zenith. If a star on one night passes through the center of eyepiece, one must observe it six month later, and see if the star has been offset by the center. A shift would mean a measure of parallax.   |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1842   |  Zero-age horizontal branch stars     |  A star that has arrived on the horizontal branch after leaving the red giant branch. It begins helium burning in its core.   |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1847   |  ZZ Ceti stars    |  A member of a class of non-radially pulsating stars that change their brightnesses with periods from 30 seconds to 25 minutes and amplitudes from 0.001 to 0.2 mag in V. Their location on the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram identifies them as white dwarf stars that have entered the instability strip as they evolve along the white dwarf track.  |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1848   |  DZ stars     |  A white dwarf whose spectrum shows metal lines only; no H or He.     |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1849   |  DQ stars     |  A white dwarf whose spectrum shows carbon features of any kind.  |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1850   |  Shell stars  |  A main-sequence star, usually of spectral class B to F, whose spectrum shows bright emission lines superimposed on the normal absorption lines. The emission spectrum is explained by the presence of a circumstellar shell of gas surrounding the star at the equator. Shell stars are fast rotators.   |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1852   |  X-ray transient sources  |  An X-ray source that enhances its emission well above its usual level for a period typically longer than a week. Recurrences can be periodic or aperiodic, but there is no obvious correlation between recurrence time and the luminosity amplitude of the outburst. X-ray transients seem to be divided into two classes: those associated with high-mass X-ray binary (HMXB) stars and those associated with low-mass X-ray binary (LMXB) stars. The HMXBs contain a neutron star or black hole paired with a massive star. Often, the stellar companion is a Be star, Be star, which sometimes sheds material from its equatorial region. In these systems, the transient event is characterized by having more higher energy X-rays in the spectrum. The LMXBs contain a neutron star or black hole orbiting around a cooler, low-mass star. These transient events often generate more lower-energy X-rays.     |

|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1880   |  Galaxy dark matter halos     |  A vast region surrounding a galaxy where dynamical tracers reveal a large amount of hidden mass. The halo has considerable mass but relatively low luminosity, suggesting the presence of a lot of dark matter.  |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1882   |  Astrostatistics  |  A branch of applied mathematics that deals with the collection and interpretation of quantitative data and the use of probability theory to estimate population parameters, applied to astronomy.    |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1883   |  Algorithms   |  A step-by-step problem-solving procedure, especially an established, recursive computational procedure for solving a problem in a finite number of steps.    |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1896   |  Normal distribution  |  A theoretical frequency distribution for a set of variable data, usually represented by a bell-shaped curve with a mean at the center of the curve and tail widths proportional to the standard deviation of the data about the mean.    |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1898   |  Poisson distribution     |  A probability function that characterizes discrete random events occurring independently of one another within some definite time or space. It may be regarded as an approximation of the binomial distribution when the number of events becomes large and the probability of success becomes small. The Poisson distribution is expressed by: f(x) = (λxe-λ)/x!, where λ is the mean number of successes in the interval, e is the base of the natural logarithm, and x is the number of successes we are interested in.   |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1907   |  Classification   |  The systematic grouping of astronomical objects into categories on the basis of physical, morphological, or evolutionary characteristics.    |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1908   |  Clustering   |  Grouping of a number of similar astronomical objects.    |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1910   |  Deconvolution    |  A mathematical operation that allows to restore the original input signal, such as an astronomical image or spectrum, to its state before being affected by the atmospheric turbulence and the transfer function of the instrument.  |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1911   |  Detection    |  Any operation on an electrical or electromagnetic signal to recover information from it.     |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1914   |  Regression   |  A method for fitting a curve through a set of points using some goodness-of-fit criterion. The most common type of regression is linear regression.  |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1918   |  Wavelet analysis     |  A refinement of Fourier analysis which enables to simplify the description of a complicated function in terms of a small number of coefficients. The formal history of wavelet theory began in the early 1980s when Jean Morlet, a French geophysicist, introduced the concept of wavelet and studied wavelet transform as a new tool for scientific signal analysis. In 1984, his collaboration with Alex Grossmann yielded a detailed mathematical study of the continuous wavelet transforms and their various applications. Although similar results had already been obtained 20-50 years earlier by several other researchers, the rediscovery of the old concepts provided a new method for decomposing functions.    |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1924   |  Bayes' Theorem   |  A theorem in probability theory concerned with determining the conditional probability of an event when another event has occurred. Bayes' theorem allows revision of the original probability with new information. Its simplest form is: P(A|B) = P(B|A) P(A)/P(B), where P(A): independent probability of A, also called prior probability; P(B): independent probability of B; P(B|A): conditional probability of B given A has occurred; P(A|B): conditional probability of A given B has occurred, also called posterior probability. Same as Bayes' rule.     |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1929   |  Smoothing    |  The mathematical process that makes a curve smooth.  |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1941   |  Solar analogs    |  A member of a class of unevolved or slightly evolved Population I disk stars with an effective temperature, degree of evolution, metallicity, and kinematic property not very different from those of the Sun.   |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1945   |  Linear regression    |  In statistics, a regression method that establishes a linear relationship between two random variables.  |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1959   |  Lomb-Scargle periodogram     |  An algorithm for detecting and characterizing periodic signals in unevenly-sampled data. The Lomb-Scargle periodogram has a particularly wide use within the astronomy community. This method allows efficient computation of a Fourier-like power spectrum estimator from such unevenly-sampled data, resulting in an intuitive means of determining the period of oscillation.     |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1963   |  Hydrodynamics    |  The branch of physics dealing with the motion, energy, and pressure of neutral fluids.   |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1964   |  Magnetohydrodynamics     |  The dynamics of an ionized plasma in the non-relativistic, collisional case. In this description, charge oscillations and high frequency electromagnetic waves are neglected. It is an important field of astrophysics since plasma is one of the commonest forms of matter in the Universe, occurring in stars, planetary magnetospheres, and interplanetary and interstellar space.    |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1973   |  Spectropolarimetry   |  A technique of observation in  astrophysics which combines spectroscopy and polarization measurements. Spectropolarimetry has a wide range of applications in astrophysics, including stellar magnetic field studies.    |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1990   |  Solar E corona   |  A part of the solar corona defined by the emission lines of hot gases. These emission lines include the so-called forbidden lines of the strongly ionized atoms of iron, calcium, and other elements. The E corona is thinner than the K corona and the F corona.    |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1991   |  Solar F corona   |  The exterior part of the solar corona, illuminated by solar light scattered or reflected by dust particles. The same phenomenon also produces the zodiacal light, much farther away from the Sun. The dust particles are at most several microns in size and make up a disk stretching over almost 1 solar radius (700,000 km) from the Sun's surface. Unlike electrons, which are responsible for the K corona, the dust particles move relatively slowly. Thus, the light scattered by them has the same spectrum as the photosphere and shows the Fraunhofer lines. The F corona is the most luminous part of the corona at 1.5 solar radii from the Sun's surface.   |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/2001   |  Solar dynamo     |  A model for explaining the generation of the solar magnetic field and the related observational features (mainly solar cycle, Sporer's law, Hale's law, Joy's law, polarity reversal). The global frame of this model is the interaction between a turbulent plasma in the convective zone (reciprocal generation of magnetic and electric fields) and the solar differential rotation (mutual transformation of meridional magnetic field into azimuthal magnetic field).   |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/2005   |  Rich galaxy clusters     |  A galaxy cluster with a particularly large number of galaxies.   |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/2025   |  Irregular natural satellites (Extrasolar)    |  A satellite whose orbit around its exoplanet is eccentric, inclined with respect to the equatorial plane, and relatively far from the planet. Strong stellar perturbations cause the orbit to precess.   |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/2027   |  Irregular satellites     |  A satellite whose orbit around its planet is eccentric, inclined with respect to the equatorial plane, and relatively far from the planet. Strong solar perturbations cause the orbit to precess.    |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/2028   |  Cooling flows    |  A phenomenon observed in a cluster of galaxies, whereby the cluster core loses energy via X-ray radiation because of the collisions between the gas particles. The radiation rate is proportional to the square of the density, and the cooling time, which remains in the outer parts too large, becomes smaller than the Hubble time in the core. As a result, the central regions of clusters of galaxies cool down; and since in the center of a cluster gas pressure and gravitational attraction are in equilibrium, the gas density has to rise to maintain the pressure necessary for supporting the outer layers of gas. To cause its density to rise, the cooled gas has to flow inward. As the densest gas, which cools quickest, is already concentrated in the center of the cluster, the inward flow will start at the center, soon followed by the outer layers. This flow of gas is called the cooling flow. Cooling flows are moderated through feedback due to the supermassive black hole in the nucleus of the central galaxy. The gas inflow to the center fuels the active galactic nucleus (AGN). The latter then heats again the gas through its radio jets.     |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/2030   |  Photometer   |  An instrument for measuring the amount of light.     |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/2036   |  Main belt asteroids  |  Asteroids in our solar system that are found in the area between Mars and Jupiter.   |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/2037   |  Space weather    |  The varying conditions in space and specifically in the near-Earth environment. Space weather is chiefly solar driven, resulting from solar activities such as solar flares, solar wind, and coronal mass ejections that affect magnetosphere, ionosphere, and thermosphere. Non-solar sources such as Galactic cosmic rays, meteoroids, and space debris can all be considered as altering space weather conditions at the Earth. Space weather may affect the performance and reliability of space-borne and ground-based technological systems and can endanger human life or health. The research in this field aims at monitoring and diagnosis of space weather conditions and constructing reliable numerical prediction models.  |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/2038   |  Solar coronal lines  |  An emission line in the spectrum of the solar corona caused by highly ionized metal ions; especially those of iron, such as the red and green lines at 6375 Å and 5303 Å [Fe X] and [Fe XIV], respectively. From their discovery in 1870 until 1939, it was believed that these forbidden lines would be due to an unknown element, called coronium. Ultraviolet and X-ray coronal lines are also detectable in stars.   |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/2039   |  Solar coronal plumes     |  A coronal feature of the Sun, which appears as long, thin streamers that project outward from the Sun's north and south poles.   |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/2041   |  Galactic bulge   |  The central galaxy bulge of the Milky Way.   |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/2042   |  Solar K corona   |  The inner part of the solar corona which extends to about two solar radii. It is due to the Thomson scattering of light from the photosphere by the free electrons in the corona. The K corona exhibits a linearly polarized continuous spectrum. The high speeds of the scattering electrons (on the average 10,000 km s^-1 for a temperature of 2 million K) smear out the Fraunhofer lines except the H and K lines.  |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/2045   |  Schonberg-Chandrasekhar limit    |  During the main sequence stage, a star burns the hydrogen in its core and transforms it into helium. When the helium mass amounts to about 10% of the initial stellar mass, the star can no longer maintain the hydrostatic equilibrium in its core; the star increases its volume and leaves the main sequence in order to become a red giant.  |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/2047   |  Main sequence    |  An evolutionary stage in the life of a star when it generates its energy by the conversion of hydrogen to helium via nuclear fusion in its core. Stars spend 90% of their life on the main sequence. On the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram it appears as a track running from top left (high temperature, high luminosity, high mass) to lower right (low temperature, low luminosity, low mass).   |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/2048   |  Horizontal branch    |  A set of roughly horizontal points in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram of a typical globular cluster. It displays a stage of stellar evolution which immediately follows the red giant branch (RGB) in stars with an initial mass < 1.2 M_sun. When the star's ascent of the RGB is terminated by the helium flash, it moves down to the Horizontal Branch (HB). The star's effective temperature on the HB is higher than it was on the RGB, but the luminosity is considerably less than at the helium flash. Usually HB stars have two energy sources: in addition to the helium burning in their cores, they experience hydrogen fusion in a surrounding shell. The thickness of the shell determines the color of the HB stars. A thin shell, involving low opacity, makes the star look blue. The HB domain encompasses a very large effective temperature range with several members: extreme HB, blue HB, RR Lyrae, red HB, and red clump stars. The locations depend on many parameters, including stellar mass, metallicity, age, helium abundance, and rotation.   |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/2050   |  Low mass stars   |  A star whose mass is around that of the Sun.     |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/2053   |  Dwarf stars  |  A star that burns its hydrogen content to produce its energy and therefore belongs to the main-sequence luminosity class.    |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/2054   |  Subdwarf stars   |  A metal-poor main-sequence star with spectral type later than M7 and luminosity class VI. They are population II dwarfs which appear less luminous than their solar metallicity counterparts due to the dearth of metals in their atmospheres. Subdwarfs are halo members with high proper motions and large heliocentric velocities. They are important tracers of the chemical enrichment history of the Galaxy and belong to the first generation of stars formed in the Galaxy (at least 10 billion years old).  |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/2057   |  Radiative recombination  |  The process by which an ionized atom binds a free electron in a plasma to produce a new atomic state with the subsequent radiation of photons.   |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/2060   |  Photoionization  |  The physical process in which an incident high-energy photon ejects one or more electrons from an atom, ion, or molecule.    |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/2068   |  Ionization   |  The process by which ions are produced, typically occurring by interaction with electromagnetic radiation ('photoionization'), or by collisions with atoms or electrons ('collisional ionization').  |

|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/2104   |  B(e) stars   |  A Be star with forbidden lines in emission in its spectrum. B[e] stars show large infrared excess due to circumstellar dust emission.    |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/2105   |  CEMP stars   |  A star that presents very low iron abundances [Fe/H] < -4 but an anomalous richness in carbon. CEMP stars have been defined as a subset of metal-poor stars that exhibit elevated [C/Fe] ≥ +1.0. It has been recognized that ~15-20% of stars with [Fe/H] < -2.0 are carbon enhanced. This fraction rises to 30% for [Fe/H] < -3.0, to 40% for [Fe/H] < -3.5, and ~75% for [Fe/H] < -4.0. This increasing trend of CEMP-star frequency with declining [Fe/H] is confirmed by the observation of many thousands of CEMP stars.    |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/2110   |  Blazhko effect   |  A long term, generally irregular modulation of light curves of a large subclass of RR Lyrae stars. Most of the modulations occur on the time scale of some 60 periods, although the range extends from some tens to some hundreds of periods. Since its discovery over a hundred years ago, a number of explanations have been proposed for this effect, but its nature is still a matter of investigation. The explanations include: closely spaced pulsation modes, a modal 1:2 resonance, an oblique rotator model, a non-radial modal interaction, convective cycles, and nonlinear resonant mode coupling between the 9th overtone and the fundamental mode.    |

The majority of low and intermediate mass stars (1 to 8 solar masses) are believed to pass through this stage on their way to becoming planetary nebulae.     |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/2127   |  Search for extraterrestrial intelligence     |  The scientific attempt to detect intelligent extraterrestrial life by surveying the sky to find the existence of transmissions, especially radio waves or light, from a civilization on a distant planet. The SETI Institute, that carries out the project, is a private non-profit center founded in 1984. There are many methods that SETI scientific teams use to search for extraterrestrial intelligence. Many of these search billions of radio frequencies that reach Earth from all over the Universe, looking for an intelligent radio signal. Other SETI teams search by looking for signals in pulses of light emanating from the stars.  |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/2129   |  Spectral energy distribution     |  A plot showing the energy emitted by a source as a function of the radiation wavelength or frequency. It is used in many branches of astronomy to characterize astronomical sources, in particular mainly in near infrared and middle infrared to study protostars or young stellar objects. The SED of these objects is divided in four classes. Class 0 in which the SED represents a very embedded protostar, where the mass of the central core is small in comparison to the mass of the accreting envelope. The SED is characterized by the blackbody radiation of the envelope and peaks at submillimeter wavelengths. Class I objects possess a SED that peaks in the far infrared and is characterized by a weak contribution of the blackbody of the central protostar (detected in near infrared) and the emission of a thick disk and dense envelope. These objects have less mass in the envelope and more massive central cores with respect to Class 0. Class II objects are the classical T Tauri stars with a SED due to the emission of a thin disk and the central star. They have accumulated most of their final mass and have dispersed almost completely their circumstellar envelope. Finally, Class III objects have pure photospheric spectra. Their SED is peaked in the optical and is well approximated by a blackbody emission with a faint infrared excess due to the presence of a residual optically thin disk that may be the origin of planetesimals. This classification scheme can be made more quantitative by defining a spectral index.  |

|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/2160   |  Comet nuclei     |  The solid, centrally located part of a comet. The nucleus is a mass of dust and frozen gases. When heated by the Sun, the gases sublimate and produce an atmosphere surrounding the nucleus known as the coma, which is later swept into an elongated tail. Reliable measurements of cometary nuclei indicate sizes from a few km to 10 or 20 km. The nucleus of Comet Hale-Bopp is one of the largest (perhaps 40 km). The composition of the nucleus is determined by measuring the composition of the coma (except for 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko). The dominant volatile is water, followed by carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, formaldehyde, methanol, methane at a few percent level (with respect to water) and many other molecules at a lower level.     |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/2163   |  Flat-spectrum radio quasars  |  A member of a small subset of quasars consisting of bright radio galaxies whose flux of visible light output can vary by as much as 50% in a single day.     |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/2164   |  Ultraluminous x-ray sources  |  An X-ray source that is not in the nucleus of a galaxy, and is more luminous than 10^39 ergs s^-1, brighter than the Eddington luminosity of a 10 solar mass black hole. In general, there is about one ULX per galaxy in galaxies which host ULXs. The Milky Way contains no such objects. ULXs are thought to be powered by accretion onto a compact object. Possible explanations include accretion onto neutron stars with strong magnetic fields, onto stellar black holes (of up to 20 solar masses) at or in excess of the classical Eddington limit, or onto intermediate-mass black holes (10^3 - 10^5 solar masses). NGC 1313X-1, NGC 5408X-1, and NGC 6946X-1 are three ULXs with X-ray luminosities up to ~10^40 erg s^-1.   |

|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/2181   |  Comet Halley     |  The most famous comet orbiting the Sun once about every 75 years. The last time it appeared was in 1986, and it is predicted to return in 2061. Its earliest recorded sighting is traced back to 240 BC in China. In 1705 Edmond Halley used Newton's new theory of gravitation to determine the orbits of comets from their recorded positions in the sky as a function of time. He found that the bright comets of 1531, 1607, and 1682 had almost the same orbits. He concluded that these appearances must belong to a single recurring comet, and predicted its return for 1758. Halley's comet is the first known periodic comet, hence its designation 1P/Halley.     |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/2182   |  Eros     |  An S-type asteroid about 34.4 × 11.2 × 11.2 km in size, which is the second-largest near-Earth asteroid after 1036 Ganymede. It belongs to the group of Amor asteroids. Eros was discovered on 13 August 1898 by Gustav Witt in Berlin and Auguste Charlois at Nice. It was the first asteroid orbited by an Earth probe (in 2000).  |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/2186   |  Titan    |  The largest and the sixth moon of Saturn discovered by Christiaan Huygens in 1655. Called also Saturn VI. Titan has a diameter of 5,150 km, about half the size of Earth and almost as large as Mars. It orbits Saturn at a mean distance of 1,221,830 km every 15.945 days. It is the only moon known to have an atmosphere. Its surface temperature is -179 °C, which makes water as hard as rocks and allows methane to be found in its liquid form. Its surface pressure is slightly higher than Earth's pressure (1.6 bars against 1 bar at sea level). The Huygens probe released from Cassini-Huygens landed on Titan on December 25, 2004. From the data obtained by Cassini-Huygens, we know that Titan is a world with lakes and seas composed of liquid methane and ethane near its poles, with vast, arid regions not made of silicates as on Earth, but of solid water ice coated with hydrocarbons that fall from the atmosphere. Titan's icy dunes are gigantic, reaching, on average, 1 to 2 km wide, hundreds kilometers long and around 100 m high. Titan is the only other place in the solar system known to have an Earth-like cycle of liquids flowing across its surface as the planet cycles through its seasons. Each Titan season lasts about 7.5 Earth years. The Huygens probe made the first direct measurements of Titan's lower atmosphere. Huygens also directly sampled aerosols in the atmosphere and confirmed that carbon and nitrogen are their major constituents. Cassini followed up Huygens' measurements from orbit, detecting other chemicals that include propylene and poisonous hydrogen cyanide, in Titan's atmosphere. Cassini's gravity measurements of Titan revealed that this moon is hiding an internal, liquid water and ammonia ocean beneath its surface. Huygens also measured radio signals during its descent that strongly suggested the presence of an ocean 55 to 80 km below the moon's surface.  |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/2187   |  Triton   |  The seventh and the largest of Neptune's satellites. It has a diameter of 2,700 km and orbits its planet at a mean distance of 354,760 km every 5.877 days. Triton was discovered by William Lassell in 1846 scarcely a month after Neptune was discovered. Triton is colder than any other measured object in the solar system with a surface temperature of -235° C. It has an extremely thin atmosphere. Nitrogen ice particles might form thin clouds a few kilometers above the surface. The atmospheric pressure at Triton's surface is about 15 microbars, 0.000015 times the sea-level surface pressure on Earth. Triton is the only large satellite in the solar system to circle a planet in a retrograde motion, that is in a direction opposite to the rotation of the planet.   |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/2188   |  Ganymede     |  The seventh and largest of Jupiter's known satellites. This Galilean satellite has a diameter of 5270 km, slightly larger than Mercury, a mass about 1.48 × 10^23 kg (about 2 Earth Moons); an orbital period of 7.155 days, and an eccentricity of e = 0.0015. It was discovered by Galileo and Marius in 1610. The mean surface temperature of Ganymede is -160 °C. It is the only moon known to have a magnetosphere.     |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/2189   |  Europa   |  The sixth of Jupiter's known moons and the fourth largest; it is the second of the Galilean satellites. With a diameter of 3140 km, Europa is slightly smaller than Earth's Moon. Its mass is 4.80 × 10^22 kg, i.e. 1.5 times less massive than Earth Moon. Its distance to Jupiter is 670,900 km, or about 9 Jovian radii. Its orbital period is 3.55 Earth days which equals its rotation period. Europa's density is 3.0 g cm^-3, typical of a mixture of rocks including ice. Its high albedo (0.67) suggests that its surface is mostly water ice. The surface temperature of Europa ranges between about 125 K (-150 °C) at the equator and about 50 K (-220 °C) at the poles. There are few impact craters on Europa, because its surface is too active and therefore young. The most striking features of Europa's surface are structures called lineae and lenticulae. The thickness of the ice crust could range between a few kilometers to a few tens of kilometers. It is now believed that there is an ocean of salty water, up to 100 km deep, flowing under Europa's ice. Europa's ocean is kept liquid due to tidal heating by Jupiter.     |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/2190   |  Io   |  The fifth of Jupiter's known moons and the third largest. It is the innermost of the Galilean satellites. With a diameter of 3630 km, Io is slightly larger than Earth's Moon. It revolves at a mean distance of 422,000 km from Jupiter. Its mass is 8.93 x 10^22 kg (about 1.2 Earth Moons) and its orbital period 1.8 Earth days. The mean surface temperature of Io is -155 °C. Io's yellow color derive from sulfur and molten silicate rock. The unusual surface of Io is kept very young by its system of active volcanoes. The intense tidal force of Jupiter stretches Io and damps wobbles caused by Jupiter's other Galilean moons. The resulting friction greatly heats Io's interior, causing molten rock to explode through the surface. Io's volcanoes are so active that they are effectively turning the whole moon inside out. Some of Io's volcanic lava is so hot it glows in the dark.  |

|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/2192   |  Aurorae  |  A phenomenon consisting of luminous colorful arcs, rays, and streamers that appear in a planet's upper atmosphere during the night with the greatest frequency in the northern and southern polar magnetic zones. This non-thermal radiation is caused by the emission of light from atoms excited by electrons accelerated along the planet's magnetic field lines at the magnetic poles. Fluorescent emission from atomic oxygen at 5557 Å results in a greenish glow, and there is a weaker effect from the red line at 6300 Å. Blue and purple colors are emitted by atomic and molecular nitrogen.  |
