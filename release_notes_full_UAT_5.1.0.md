#### Definitions added for 7 concepts:

| Concept URI | PrefLabel | Definition |
| --- | --- | --- |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/628  |  Gamma-ray astronomy  |  The study of gamma rays from extraterrestrial sources, especially gamma-ray bursts.  Gamma-rays are an electromagnetic wave with a typical wavelength less than 10-2Å (10-12 m), corresponding to frequencies above 1019 Hz and photon energies above 100 keV.   |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/729  |  Hickson compact group  |  A list of 100 compact groups of galaxies that were identified by a systematic search of the Palomar Observatory Sky Survey red prints. Each group contains four or more galaxies, has an estimated mean surface brightness brighter than 26.0 magnitude per arcsec2 and satisfies an isolation criterion.  |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/786  |  Infrared astronomy   |  The study of infrared properties of astronomical objects. Infrared is the invisible part of electromagnetic spectrum possessing wavelengths between those of visible light and those of radio waves, i.e. approximately between about 0.75 and 1000 μm.  |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1329   |  Radar astronomy  |  Astronomy in which celestial bodies in the solar system are studied by analyzing the return of radio waves directed at them.   |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1338   |  Radio astronomy  |  The branch of astronomy that deals with the study of the Universe by means of radio waves. Radio waves are the electromagnetic radiation with the longest wavelengths (and lowest energies), ranging from 0.3 mm to several km. Radio waves form a very broad category, which includes the submillimeter waves (with a wavelengths of 0.3-1 mm) and microwave regions (1mm to several cm).   |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1776   |  Optical astronomy  |  An area of astronomy where astronomers observe and analyse light from the Universe that falls within the wavelength range that the human eye is sensitive to, about 400 nm (violet) to 750 nm (red), which is also referred to as visible light.   |
|   http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1810   |  X-ray astronomy  |  The study of celestial bodies using their X-ray emission. X-ray astronomy deals mainly with Galactic and extragalactic phenomena involving very high-energy photon emissions, covering a band of energies between 0.1 keV and 500 keV. The research field includes: X-ray binaries, cataclysmic variables, pulsars, black holes, dark matter, active galaxies, galactic clusters X-ray transients. The Earth's atmosphere absorbs most X-rays coming from outer space. X-ray astronomy therefore requires observations to be done above atmosphere.  |
